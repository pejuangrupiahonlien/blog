<p>Computers are one of the most interesting and complex machines on the planet. They have the ability to intrigue anyone who sits down and attempts to use it. On the other hand though, they also have the ability to confuse the heck out of you! When  I think about computers, I think about the internet, Microsoft Word (for school), and games. What sort of computer I buy should be user friendly in all three of these aspects.</p>

<p>First you have to make a big decision… Apple or Windows. They both have great features, and are both more user friendly for each individule user. Windows is compatible with several computer manufacturers, including HP Pavilion, Compaq, and Dell.</p>

<p>Now, in my case, I need to take a close look at each option, as I have specific uses for my machine. When purchasing a computer you should be aware of what your main purpose with it is. For some it is business, others gaming, and for many, it is used for school. Make sure you test each version, Apple and Windows. If Apple seems the most compatible with your purpose, then congradulations! Your choice is made. But if you decide Apple is not right for you, take a look at all the operating systems that there is for Windows. There are several, each with different features, and you should choose the one that is right for you.</p>

<p>As you can see, the purchase of a computer is not always black and white. What’s it going to be for you?</p>
