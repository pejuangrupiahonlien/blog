I"<p>Homeschooling has increased more in the past few years than it has for the past decades. Initially, homeschooling or any type of private education wasnt allowed in the United States, but when a public court ruled for the Society of Sisters for the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary and allowed them to set up a private school in 1925, public schools werent the only institutions providing education to children. This sparked the homeschooling idea and not long after, parents have decided to educate their children in their own homes.</p>
