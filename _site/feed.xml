        <title>Why Do We Even Need MySpace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Myspace Layouts, Myspace Backgrounds, Myspace Codes, Myspace Graphics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are part of MySpace, and that you have plenty of friends. Besides having a lot of friends, there will also be new ones who might approach you. You can also meet a lot of acquaintances for various reasons. The profile will have to look interesting; else no one will be able to take any sort of interest in them. Imagine you have to look at the same settings for all profiles; it would be boring of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the MySpace layouts will come into the picture. You will need layouts to customize the profiles to a great extent. You can do a great job with the profiles, as there will be a lot of layouts to choose from. This will be exciting to do, as there are so many unique ones to pick from. This is not only the idea of layouts; it is also to make the concept of the profiles different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layouts are needed for the profiles because the site is extremely popular. There are millions of users and if everyone has the same settings, it would become extremely boring. This is what the main purpose of the layouts is. You can also choose so many according to the themes that you have in mind, that there will be no shortage of layouts to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are bound to be millions of visitors on the site, having different layouts will make a huge difference. You can easily talk about your interests and specific likes through this. All you need to do is pick one, which would suit your requirements. It could be about a film star, or it could be about some sport that you are passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using specific MySpace layouts on the profiles will make you stand out from the crowd. This way, you will talk about yourself and you can also attract as many friends as you can. This will keep your profile very exciting, as the main purpose of you using the site is to network. You should not think much about using the layouts, as there will be easy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are so many themes and colors to choose from, there will be a lot of difference to the profile. You can also highlight a lot of things in the profile, by choosing the apt design as well as colors. This is what will make the profile unique. By being unique there will be so many things that you can do. You can create a number of networks based on the interests you are showcasing, using the help of layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySpace layouts are needed for profiles, as no two profiles need look the same. When each profile looks different, the community will begin to take a new looks altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Change To Windows Vista: Part 2 of 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Windows, Vista, Windows Vista, Tennessee, Mountain Man, remote helpdesk, help desk, helpdesk, outsourced it services, remote computer repair, online computer repair, outsourced helpdesk, outsourced help desk, outsourced computer repair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Change To Windows Vista:  Part 3 of 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are almost there, this is part 3 of 4.  Actually it has somewhat more meat than Part 2, but once again starts trailing off towards the last few reasons covered by the Tennessee Mountain Man today.  Computer man can’t help but wonder if a third grader actually did prepare Microsoft’s reasons to smile or upgrade to Vista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#51. “Because you live to play”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Mountain Man actually wishes Microsoft had this one right for the average American.  But, alas Americans play less than the citizenry of most other countries.  Outsourced computer repair techs, unlike the money moguls at Microsoft, recognizes it now takes two people working not only full time but over time to feed and clothe the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because we love to play”, may have been more accurate; but living to play?  Americans have long proven their propensity to live for work unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote helpdesk 1 is the proof in the pudding!  Who has time for computer games?  As to whether Windows Vista makes the games easier, faster, more fun….give me a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#52. “ Take control of game time”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#53. “Because you can get more done when you work together”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s brain storming appears to have produced great and long followed general rules for success in any endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;
“The house divided against itself cannot stand”.  Mutual cooperation on the job, in sports, or in family affairs goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to inviting people to work with you on projects over the Internet, a company network, or an ad-hoc wireless network….We had been doing that for years… long before Windows XP was corrupted to come up with Windows Vista simply to enrich Microsoft coffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#54. “Stay entertained wherever you go”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these remind old online computer repair geezers of some of the motel ads on TV.  Come On!!!!!!!!!!  Wow!  Online helpdesk would have never thought of that little trick before Vista and without the help of Bill Gates!  N E X T !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#55. “Because success tomorrow starts today”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen!!!!! Today is the first day of the rest of your life, but P L E A S E  get a life.  Hopefully not after Microsoft’s blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this reason, like most of their reasoning, appears to be little more than someone “making work” or needing to fill newspaper space.  Speaking of needing to get a life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#56. “Print what you see”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogwash!!!!  Unlike the rest of mankind, apparently Microsoft never heard of Windows 3 or the “print screen” command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#57. “Because you don’t need a PC to watch your home movies”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really?  Can you say Kodak?  How about Polaroid?  Well, don’t!  Outsourced it services still needs the online pc repair work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#58. “Fill your home with music”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, please!  Music soothes the savage beast!  Maybe Microsoft needs something besides elevator music, however.
We used to do that with a radio which had a red light that burned when the radio was on.  As a lad the Tennessee Mountain Man used to set for hours with an eye glued to that light watching radio shows.  Those were the days!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dacomputerman knows all about that! That was all before WMP 11 and Microsoft’s control over his entertainment choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#59. “Make a masterpiece”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Blend your photos and home videos into a rich movie experience, complete with soundtrack, titles and credits, and creative transitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Microsoft can report you!  You do know, they know what you had for dinner last evening and whether you skipped breakfast this morning, don’t you?  Listen….sounds like they are the phone with an artist formerly known as Prince now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#60. “Because you want your video memories to stay true to life”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Windows Movie Maker lets you retain high-definition quality as you capture, edit, and publish movies from your HD camcorder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remote computer repair folks told me this is “déjà vu all over again”.  Dacomputerman thought he was just getting old and senile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don’t forget this little ditty:  “Some product features are only available in certain editions of Windows Vista and may require advanced or additional hardware”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#61. “Stand strong against hackers”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The easy-to-use Windows Firewall with Advanced Security provides advanced protection to help shield you and your PC from malicious attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on…come on!  Stop laughing and get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#62. “Because it remembers what you like to doand helps you do it faster”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please refer to MS#59 above!  Then go immediately to the Prefetch File located in C:\Windows and dump it’s contents.  Do this daily and note the improvement in OS response time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#63. “Help is always available”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now most people have learned to avoid the helpdesk of major computer companies including Microsoft…maybe especially Microsoft and certainly especially if your first language is English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately also most people ignore the recommendation in this reasoning.  Otherwise a lot of us would be out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#64. “Keep your files confidential”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you say, déjà vu once again?  Swamp land, anyone?  anyone?  how about a bridge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#65 “Send a fax on the spot”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Windows Fax and Scan makes sending and receiving faxes directly from your PC as simple as using e-mail. With fax templates linked to your address book, it’s easy to retrieve a fax number, attach your documents, and just click to send.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos!!!!!!  someone caught sleeping?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#66. “Because everyone goofs sometimes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never heard of restore points before Vista ,huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#67. “Because e-mail is your lifeline”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#68. “Stay on top of your family’s schedule”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old magnet on the refrigerator didn’t work, I doubt this will.  But maybe it will work better for you than for the old da computer man,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#69. “Because you want the quality of your printouts to match the quality of your work”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K.  Kudos!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#70. “Your PC is ready when you are”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is your significant other!!  Right.  Just keep the aspirin handy…headaches do happen! And, don’t miss the standard little caveat at the end of the reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#71. “Keep your favorite things at your fingertips”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite things have nothing to do with computers or Windows Vista.
Please excuse the computer man while he day dreams a bit.  Favorite things…O.K. unmentionable.  So move on to Meerschaum pipe, BCA smoking tobacco, Scotch, T Bone, Lobster….alright…alright…moving along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#72. “Get the latest news delivered right to your desktop”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;schhhhhhh!  Please don’t tell Microsoft that these news tickers have been around forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#73. “Because your photos and home movies don’t have to be stuck in your PC anymore”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ho!  hum!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#74. “Because your memories need a little mood music”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times and ways can we say, déjà vu?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#75. “Because you want professional-looking photos from your own printer”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, How many times can you take, déjà vu?  If only Microsoft had considered that question!!

        <title>Why Change To Windows Vista:  Part 3 of 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Windows, Vista, Windows Vista, Tennessee, Mountain Man, remote helpdesk, help desk, helpdesk, outsourced it services, remote computer repair, online computer repair, outsourced helpdesk, outsourced help desk, outsourced computer repair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Change To Windows Vista: Part 2 of 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having caught his breath and dispatched the laugh monster (just in time for Halloween) the Tennessee Mountain Man is ready to resume his look at Microsoft’s 100 Reasons Why we should be using Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Part 1 of Why Change To Windows Vista, Remote Helpdesk 1, examined Microsoft’s reasons 1 through 25.  Today we will cover reasons 26 - 50 so lets get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#26. “Because you’re a multitasker”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Scientific studies reveal the hidden costs of multitasking as technology increasingly tempts people to do more than one thing at a time Bill Gates and Microsoft keep pushing for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone were tempting Microsoft employees to use anything other than best practices there would be one of Microsoft’s infamous law suits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aren’t all of us forced to multi task toooo much as it is?  Back off Gates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#27. “ Because your computer can keep up with you while you’re on the go”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lik
e the pager and the cell phone, the curse of the hand held, laptop, note book and other portables is that all technology, including our computers, have kept up with us too well…no uninterrupted vacations, dinners, shows, golf games, or romantic sessions.  Get this contraption out of my bedroom!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#28. “Enjoy your memories, larger than life”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, The Tennessee Mountain Man finds nothing new here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#29. “Take the handwritten approach”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K. Been around forever.  Ever checked out at the store or used an ATM with a touch screen?  How about Monday Night Football?  Been there, done that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#30. “Restore your PC in an instant”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!  I know I am not as smart as the Microsoft gurus but haven’t that covered this already, in Part 1 maybe?!  I guess that is why he is Bill Gates owning Microsoft and I own a remote helpdesk performing online computer repair services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the army we taught by telling students what we were going to teach them, doing the teaching, and then reiterating what we had told them.  But, we didn’t try to cover it up calling it three different lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  Don’t miss their last caveat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#31. “Because your PC lets you know if something’s wrongand helps you fix it”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, The Tennessee Mountain Man could find nothing new here either unless the user has been more lazy than most.  It was all available with earlier, faster, less expensive, and less intrusive operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Tennessee Mountain Man is in danger of becoming repetitive, but Microsoft is not giving me anything to work with here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#32. “Streamline IT management across your business”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh!!!!! So!!!!!!! It is actually just an upgrade Microsoft Server 2003 with all the patches and fixes included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#33. “Preserve a lifetime of memories”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a back up feature!!!!  Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#34. “Connect to the network at work or school”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention connecting at your motel, Mickey D’s, your grand ma’s, and a million other places.  Kids and businessmen have been doing this for years…Next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#35. “Because you’ll know it when you see it”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we haven’t seen it yet….moving right along….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#36. “Get a “do-over” when you need it”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have some swamp property I need to unload before you lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#37. “Keep your info under lock and key”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be the best reason so far. But, let’s face it, if Microsoft and the U.S. Government can’t keep hackers out of their own stuff do you really think you have a chance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, have you lost the pass words to get into today’s IBM laptops?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#38. “It’s the cure for red-eye”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they were not brazen enough to say it would keep you from working nights.  What they are doing is touting an existing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#39. “Relive your memorieseach and every one”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K. Microsoft likes to be redundant, remote computer repair services does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#40. “Because you love what you do”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when the windows operating don’t crash or lock up, and performs more reliably like Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But watch Microsoft’s caveat at the end of this reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#41. “Because your PC will stay up to date, automatically”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has it not done that for years?   Oh, yes, I’m sorry.  The Tennessee Mountain Man almost forgot.  This is apparently our warning that Microsoft will come through the back door and make any changes they want whenever they wish despite our desires and upgrade and maintenance settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#42. “E-mail your photos without worrying about the file size”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, really?  The ISP on each end of the spectrum may have different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#43. “It’s parent friendly”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is that supposed to mean?  It is slow?  Because it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry they are referring to parental controls like the ones parents and bosses have used forever.  Got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#44. “Because you have a need for speed”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Need to speed up your computer? Simply plug a USB memory stick into your desktop or notebook computer and let Windows ReadyBoost do the rest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K., I could, but I won’t.  Kudos!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#45. “Because you hate all those boxes and wires”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we had already eliminated them…..next…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#46. “Your music can look as good as it sounds”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Branson maybe!  Now just what does this do that is an improvement over XP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#47. “Let the fun start now”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we having fun yet?  No!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#48. “Stay connected wherever you go”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duh!!!!!!  We just covered this subject!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#49. “Take your workspace with you”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft remains redundant, I can’t help but respond….The labor laws of the U.S. makes provisions for breaks and meal times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to get away on occasion and Microsoft wants a robot chasing me around demanding more…more…more…more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#50. “Get more out of the web”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the caveat as Microsoft makes a johnny come lately feeble attempt to catch up with other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Tennessee Mountain Man speechless yet?  No, but we’ll take another stab at it tomorrow with “Why Change To Windows Vista:  Part 3 of 4”.

        <title>Why Are Many Colors Used With Myspace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Myspace is the only online community, which offers various options for layouts. Since it is a very large community with millions of users, there are bound to be expectations for the kind of presentations with the layouts. Myspace layouts are available for free, and they are used by all members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are designed by various designers and the concepts vary, but they are all upgraded to the sites as often as possible. They are categorized according to the themes, so that it is easy for any user to pick the layout that he wants. Many hundreds of colors with various color combinations are used with Myspace layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because people want to break the monotony of the use of the same layouts again and again. Since most communities normally have default settings, users are bound to get bored with the outlook of the profile. With Myspace too, the default settings get boring for all the millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be solved with the variety of the Myspace layouts. All the colors used with these layouts are versatile, and so are the combinations. The number of colors available is innumerable as well, and all users have a variety of choice. By using these various colors, the entire outlook of the profile will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors are also picked according to the theme of the profile. Not only do they make the profile colorful, sometimes the colors will blend so well with the theme, that it makes the whole thing very interesting. Users will thus never get bored of visiting profiles. They will be offered a variety of colors to look at, and they will be pleasing to the eye as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various colors also offer a scope to be creative, and they can use them as they please. All Myspace layouts available on all sites are completely free of cost and will be of complete variety as well. There is also no end to the number of colors being used with these layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will be of all sorts and shades, and will suit any requirement of the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members can pick themes with various colors, according to what they have written on the profile. For example, if they are fans of witchcraft, they may use foreboding colors, and if they are fans of cartoons, they may use peppy colors. All this depends on how they want to project the profile as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Myspace layouts is really exciting as there are so many to choose from. Members may keep changing every week if they want, or according to their convenience. This allows for a very interesting activity, as the profile gets different looks often. You need not be technical wizards to use these layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Are Laptop Batteries So Bad?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like most people with laptops you know that they are only as portable as the nearest outlet. The companies advertise like their laptop batteries make these machines so that they can go anywhere with you and there will be no problem but there is a problem. You only have a couple hours max of normal word processing type use and then you are toast unless you either have a backup battery or you can plug in somewhere and recharge. The other problem is that lots of places that you go and that you would love to use a laptop at aren�t able to supply outlets to everyone and so you are up a creek as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my main question for this piece is why are laptop batteries so bad? To answer this question I am going to do a quick search on the internet and try to quickly glean as much information as I can in the next few minutes and then I will proceed to pack it in to the next 2 paragraphs or so. Here I go�.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well we will start with what most batteries are made of and that is Lithium Ion cells (older laptop batteries were made of nickel cadmium). These batteries have several advantages including no memory and no scheduled cycling (That does not mean however that it is a good idea to repeatedly run your battery dead). These batteries are therefore low maintenance. However because their cell oxidation can not be reversed through cycling there is a definite and short lifespan for these batteries. This turns out to be around two to three years and is not necessarily lengthened by not using as oxidation goes on in the form of self discharge even when stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is recommended that one stores the battery at about 40% capacity and in a cool place. The 40% capacity gives it the ability to self discharge slowly without going all the way dead (which is bad for these laptop batteries, if you recall). These batteries will oxidize more slowly in cooler temperatures which prolongs the life. These power cells are not meant for long term storage as already mentioned because the self discharge will drain it sometimes to the point of no return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why these new laptop batteries are so much more expensive than they used to be is because they require an internal circuit that prevents it from overcharging. Overcharging can cause the battery to heat up and actually burst into flames.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Should Use Myspace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with the Internet, you are most likely to have an account on MySpace. This is an exciting online community, which allows people to have free memberships. You can post the profile for free, and there are many options available for this community. There are free MySpace layouts available for all members to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone having an account on this site should use MySpace layouts. These layouts come with various themes as well as colors, and all members will find what they want. Some may wonder why they should apply new layouts when there are already default settings on the site. However using MySpace layouts will give a completely new look and feel to the profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any member on this site should take some effort and should try and find a good layout that will suit their profile. Trying to match the profile with some good layout is very important. This is because it will speak volumes about the person�s interests and also outlook towards their presence on the community. Members could be present for networking in various groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus a member should try and pick an appropriate layout for his profile. MySpace layouts are probably the simplest techniques that one can follow with any site creation. Each one has a code, and the code has to be copy pasted on to the profile homepage and it is immediately updated. Within a few seconds the profile is sporting a new look and it will make it all the more interesting to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the greatest benefit for those using MySpace layouts. They may not only access these for free, they can apply it very easily. Even if you are a fan of a Hollywood movie star, you can find that layout on some site. All you need to do is hunt for it in the right way and on the right site. If all members use the MySpace layouts that are available on the sites, then they would make the whole community more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are always navigating through sites, and looking for new friends. When they access profiles, and they find a layout that they like, they are sure to even apply it to their own profiles. However that is not the main part of MySpace layouts. It is to provide a lot of creativity to the profiles, and also allow the members to get as versatile as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not a compulsion for users to pick MySpace layouts, it is always better for people to use a variety. It would make a huge difference from default settings, as the themes available are simply astounding. Designers are constantly coming up with various layouts, so that members will be satisfied. The variety will allow the members to have a fine time, what with the choosing and applying.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Posts Free MySpace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of free MySpace layouts on the Internet. They are used specifically for the site, and almost all members try to be a part of these layouts by picking them. Though there are so many layouts available, there is always the doubt whether these layouts are free or not. Many sites have been dedicated to the free MySpace layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways today with which someone can promote a site. Thus many of these sites related to free layouts for MySpace will also get promotion. This is because they will use various methods to advertise, and they will also get a lot of advertisements on the sites as well. There are many designers who create these layouts and post them for free on various sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since MySpace is very popular on the Internet, these designers know that they will be allowed to post many free MySpace layouts. They will post as many as they can, and they are also coming out with a lot of designs every day. Most sites are being updated with the free layouts almost every day. This means that there are many designers on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who are interested in designing layouts will do so, and they will post them on sites. This is also an interesting concept, because we get to see the creativity of many designers. They will choose to pick various themes, and they will also bring out a lot of new things that members have never seen. This will keep the members happy, as they are getting a lot of variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at the popularity of the free MySpace layouts, designers are coming up with various designs often. Each one is competing as well, and this makes it all the more exciting. This allows for a lot of challenge in the creativity of the layouts, as there will be room for many themes. Designers could be anyone, and just about anyone who is interested in posting free MySpace layouts can do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility to these sites is also very easy, and one can pick free MySpace layouts anytime they want. They can also choose the design of anyone. They will be posted according to the categories, and they will not be used for any other site other than MySpace. These designers have only one goal, and that is to make the members satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do this by coming up with highly innovative themes, even such as cartoons and various other interesting topics. These designers always try to keep their work very challenging, as they will try to keep improving each time they post a free layout. Users must make as much use as possible, as the free MySpace layouts are very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blog For Fun</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Blogging for Profit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is becoming an increasingly popular way for entrepreneurs to earn a living online while doing something they really enjoy. In many cases bloggers can profit with very little effort. There may be quite a bit of work involved in the beginning with designing a method of gaining revenue and promoting the website but once this is established simply maintaining the blog with regular postings may be enough to keep the revenue rolling in. Two of the most popular methods for generating a profit from blogging include advertising methods. This includes advertising with AdSense and securing independent advertisers. This article will discuss these two methods of advertising on a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using AdSense to Generate Revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using AdSense is one of the most popular ways for bloggers to generate revenue from their blog. This method is so popular because it is also very simple. AdSense is a program offered by Google where bloggers agree to have advertisements on their website and are compensated when users click on these advertisements. Bloggers simply have to create a blog and submit the website address of the blog as well as some other information to apply for participation in AdSense. Once a blog is approved the owner is given code they can simply copy and paste to have advertisements displayed on their blog. Google then serves appropriate advertisements each time the blog is accessed. Whenever possible, the advertisements served on the blog are closely related to the content of the blog because Google crawls the website ahead of time to determine which advertisements are relevant to the content. Blog owners do have some ability to place restrictions on the types of advertisements which may appear on the blog. For example the blog owner can specify adult advertisements are not to appear on the blog and Google will filter these out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How Advertisements on a Blog Generate Revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many bloggers use advertisements on their blogs to generate a profit. This method of advertising is more difficult than using AdSense but it can be significantly more financially beneficial to the blogger. This method of advertising is similar to the type of targeted advertising often seen in magazines. For example magazines for parents often feature advertisements which will appeal to parents such as advertisements for toys, childrens clothing or foods popular with children. Likewise a magazine for runners may feature advertisements for shoes, athletic clothing, races or training equipment. In these cases the advertisers pay for advertising space in the magazine in the hopes that the magazines audience will be enticed to purchase products or services after seeing these advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog owners can use this type of advertising but it can be hard to find willing advertisers. However, there are some factors which may make an advertiser more willing to have an advertisement appear on a blog. One of the most important factors for advertisers is the amount of traffic the blog receives. This is important because advertisers who are paying for ad space are more likely to invest in a blog with high traffic than one with very little traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important factor for advertisers is the focus of the blog. Advertisers are more likely to purchase advertising space from a blog with a specific focus of interest to the advertisers target audience. Like the examples listed previously of magazines for parents and runners, advertisers want to advertise on a blog which is already reaching the same target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers who utilize advertising on their website may be compensated in a number of different ways. Some advertisers may pay a set fee for the advertisement to run on the website for either a set amount of time or for a set number of page views. This means the advertiser may purchase space for a set number of days, weeks or months or may purchase space for a set number of times the advertisement is served to website visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately the advertiser may choose to compensate the blogger according to the number of times specific actions occur. This may include users clicking through the advertisement or users making a purchase after clicking through the advertisement. The type of compensation offered will have to be worked out between the blogger and advertiser beforehand to determine a fair method of payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging with Wordpress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wordpress is one of the many options available to bloggers who are looking for free software online which makes it incredibly easy to publish their own blog. This software is easy to use, provides a variety of templates and offer excellent support to bloggers. There are many options available to bloggers and other blogging programs may be better known and offer slightly different features but many bloggers are quite pleased with Wordpress. This article will offer some useful information for bloggers who are considering starting a blog with Wordpress such as reasons to choose Wordpress, tips on starting a blog and information about the support offered by Wordpress. Based on this information as well as their own research bloggers can decide whether Wordpress is right for them or whether they should seek out a different blog network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reasons to Choose Wordpress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many great reasons to choose Wordpress to start a blog. Some of these reasons include a great variety of templates, the ability to categorize and tag posts easily, features such as spell check, previews and autosave, the ability to post text, audio files and video files, a variety of privacy options and the ability to track statistical data related to the blog in addition to other great features. Some of these features may be more important to some bloggers than others so deciding whether or not Wordpress is right for you will largely be a matter of personal preference. For example bloggers with little or no programming experience may enjoy the myriad of templates available on Wordpress while bloggers who are concerned about privacy issues may be more interested in the privacy options available through Wordpress. Carefully investigating these features will help bloggers determine if they should start a blog with Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a Blog with Wordpress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers who opt to start a blog with Wordpress will certainly not be disappointed by the amount of time it takes to start a blog. A blogger can literally start a blog with Wordpress within minutes. This is tremendously important to bloggers who are eager to get started and do not want to deal with a long process to start a blog. The only requirements for starting a blog are a valid email address and a username. The blogger enters this information into the signup page and receives a password almost instantly. Next the blogger simply has to check his email, follow the activation link provided and use the password provided and the process is complete. The blogger can start blogging immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support Offered by Wordpress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many first time bloggers the type of support offered is very important. This is because first time bloggers may have quite a few questions about the process of starting a basic blog and once they establish a basic blog they may have additional questions about using advanced features and customizing the blog. Wordpress offers a great deal of support for bloggers of all skill levels. The support offered by Wordpress includes the ability to contact the support staff as well as the ability to receive support from other members through online forums. Although the support staff is incredibly responsive some bloggers enjoy the ability to communicate with other bloggers in forums. This is because the forums are active 24 hours a day and bloggers can find support from peers at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careers in Blogging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many freelance writers are beginning to find blogging is one of the newest career opportunities available to them. Blogging is essentially a series of postings on a particular subject which are listed in reverse chronological order. These blogs may be about a variety of different subjects and may be personal, political, informative, humorous or any other category desired by the blogger. However, the key to a successful blog is a blog which pertains to a subject which appeals to a wide audience. Additionally the blog should be updated regularly and should provide useful content to the readers of the blog. This article will provide some information on finding career opportunities in blogging, will discuss the benefits of this type of career and will provide information on how writers can manage a blog successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding Blogging Career Opportunities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although blogging career opportunities are becoming increasingly popular, many writers are not aware of how to find these wonderful opportunities. These career opportunities may be offered as ghost writing positions or as positions offering a byline to the writer and finding these blogging opportunities is often very similar to finding any other career opportunities for writers. Companies seeking a blogger may post the job opening in the same manner in which they would post other openings with the company such as accounting positions or administrative positions. Therefore, writers interested in a position as a blogger should utilize the same job search websites they rely on to find other career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers may also wish to visit career websites and message boards which focus exclusively on careers in blogging. The ProBlogger.net website is just one example of a website dedicated exclusively to putting bloggers in connection with those who are interested in hiring a writer for a particular blog. Interested bloggers should also consider joining message boards for those who blog for a living. This can be beneficial because here bloggers are likely to share information regarding the companies for which they work as well as any information they have about companies who are currently looking to hire bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Benefits of a Career in Blogging&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many benefits to pursuing a career in blogging. Perhaps one of the most alluring benefits to a career in blogging is the work can typically be done as a telecommute position. This is because as long as the blogger has access to the software necessary to write and upload a blog, there is no need for the blogger to perform the work from a specific location. This means the blogger can reside virtually anywhere in the world and can likely perform the necessary work from his own home. However, not all blogging positions are telecommute positions. Some companies may require bloggers to perform the work onsite as a matter of personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit to a career in blogging is the ability to accomplish work at a pace which his convenient to the blogger. The blogger may be required to upload a new post to the blog according to a regular schedule but the actually writing of the posts can be accomplished when it is convenient for the blogger. Many blogging software packages enable the blogger to set a specific time for a specific post to be uploaded. This allows the blogger to write several posts at a time and have them publish according to a pre-determined schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding Time to Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the problems which many bloggers face is finding the time to blog. This is especially difficult if the blogger maintains several blogs or if the blogger maintains a current events blog in which posts must be timely in order to be relevant and of interest to the readers. Writing blog posts in batches and scheduling them to publish as needed is one way to deal with managing several blogs. However, writers of blogs related to current events must take special care to budget their time wisely to ensure they are publishing topical blog posts. One way this can be accomplished is by setting aside time daily to reading current events to derive inspiration and then scheduling time after that to write and publish the blog. For example a blogger with a current events blog might choose to review the previous days news the first thing in the morning to ensure they are reviewing all of the relevant news from the previous day before writing the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dealing with Comments on Your Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most blogs allow visitors to the blog to post comments on any of the blog posts. These comments may pertain to the blog posting or may be completely unrelated. The comments may also be positive or negative in nature. Regardless of the type of comment left by a visitor the blogger may choose to deal with these comments in a number of different ways. The blogger may answer these comments, block individual visitors from leaving comments in the future or use administrative features to delete comments or set the blog to require approval of the comments before they are posted on the blog. This article will discuss each of these options for dealing with comments on a blog in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering Comments on Your Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers who receive comments on their blog may wish to answer these comments. Most blogging programs allow the blogger to post comments on his own blog which enables the blogger to answer comments directly. With this feature a blogger can deal with a number of different situations including negative comments, positive comments and questions. Bloggers who receive negative comments on their blog may opt to answer these comments directly with a rebuttal to the negative comments. This allows the blogger to recognize the criticism and defend his original post. Bloggers who receive positive comments may also wish to answer these comments to thank the visitors for the praise. Still other bloggers may receive comments which ask a question about the blog post or the blogger himself. Bloggers may opt to answer these questions to develop a better relationship with the blog visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blocking Comments from Individual Visitors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option for dealing with blog comments which are negative in nature is to block comments from individual blog visitors. In most cases bloggers will have the ability to blog a particular user from leaving comments on the blog. The blogger may wish to use this option in situations where the comments from the blog visitor are extremely mean spirited. The blogger may also wish to ban individual blog visitors from making comments if he has previously attempted to explain his point to the visitor but the visitor continues to post negative comments. A blogger may also wish to ban an individual blog visitor from making comments if he believes the comments are being left as spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Administrative Features&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still another option for dealing with comments on a blog includes using administrative features to delete comments or modify the settings to not allow comments to be displayed until the blogger approves them. Blog owners typically have the ability to delete a comment left by a blog visitor. Deleting these comments is usually a quite simple process. However, it is not a completely effective method because other blog visitors may have the opportunity to read these comments before they are deleted. Therefore, deleting the comment may prevent some visitors from reading the comment but will not ensure the comment is not seen by any blog visitors. However, there is a way for bloggers to make sure visitors do not read negative comments. Most types of blogging software have options which require the blogger to approve all comments before they become available to the public. This gives the blogger the ability to delete a comment before it is read by any of the blog visitors. The blogger can simply delete any comments they do not wish others to read before the comments are published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design Elements of a Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blog may be essentially an online journal displayed in reverse chronological order but it is also a website which requires the same attention to detail any other website requires. It also requires the same design elements as a regular website which does not also function as a blog. Bloggers have decisions to make regarding design elements of the blog such as colors and layout, fonts and the inclusion of advertisements. Although many blog software programs provide a variety of templates which make designing a blog rather simple, blogs can also be highly customized by bloggers who possess some programming skills. This article will discuss some of the basic design considerations bloggers encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors and Layouts of a Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colors and layout of a blog is one of the most obvious design considerations bloggers must consider when starting or re-designing their blog. Bloggers may use a solid color background, blocks of different colors in the background or pictures or textures in the background. These background elements can be any color imaginable. However, bloggers who are considering the colors to use in their blog should consider using colors which will be aesthetically appealing to most blog visitors. This is important because the use of garish colors which are harsh on the eye can result in diminished blog traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layout of the blog should also carefully be considered by the blogger. The blog should be arranged in a fashion which is appealing to blog visitors, suits the subject of the blog and is presented in a logical manner which is easy for visitors to follow. Again, this is important because failure to use a layout which meets these criteria may result in blog visitors choosing not to visit the blog anymore because the layout is confusing or unappealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fonts Used in a Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers have a number of options available to them when selecting fonts to use in their blog. These options include the font chosen, the text size and the color of the text. Bloggers should consider choosing a font which works well with the overall design of the layout of the blog and suits the subject matter of the blog but also is a font which common. This is important because blog visitors may have trouble viewing the font if the blogger selects a unique font which is not common. The text size and colors of the text should also be carefully considered. These elements are primarily important for readability. Text size should be set so members of the target audience can easily read the text. For example a blogger with senior citizens as the target audience may opt to use a text size slightly larger than usual. The colors used for the text should also be selected to enhance readability. One way to do this is to select colors which are appealing to the eye but also contrast with the background color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inclusion of Advertisements in a Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers must also consider the inclusion of advertisements when they are designing their blogs. This includes determining whether or not to include blogs. Once this decision is made, bloggers who opt to include advertisements must carefully consider how and where they wish to display these advertisements. Advertisements can be displayed in various locations throughout the blog and can be designed to be discrete or obvious depending on the preferences of the blogger. Advertisements can also be a variety of sizes and shapes and are highly customizable in a number of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding Blogs to Read&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a wide variety of blogs currently available. Internet users are fortunate to have a large number of blogs to choose from when seeking a blog to read regularly. There are also often many blogs available which cover a particular subject. Blogs can be about any subject imaginable. Some blogs are created to entertain while others are created to inform. Some blogs are created to generate a profit while other blogs are created to help others. With so many blogs currently available online it can be difficult to determine which blogs are worth reading and which are not. It can also make it difficult to limit the number of blogs the Internet user reads. This article will provide information on finding and selecting blogs to read including using search engines to find blogs, finding blogs through participation in message boards and seeking recommendations for blogs from friends or family members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Search Engines to Find Blogs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search engines are one of the most reliable resources Internet users often rely on to find useful websites. However, it is important to note search engines can also be extremely helpful for Internet users who are interested in finding blogs to read. An Internet user who is looking for a blog on a particular subject can start the process of finding these blogs by entering relevant keywords or phrases into a popular search engine and carefully reviewing the results provided for this search. However, this type of search will not necessarily provide the Internet users with blogs. In fact the search results may not include a blog on any of the first few pages in the search results despite returning pages upon pages of links to useful websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One simple way the Internet user can use search engines to find blogs relating to a particular subject is to include the word blog with the keywords or phrases entered into the search engine. This will help to filter the search results and may push blogs towards the front of search results. However, Internet users are better off searching for collections of blogs and then searching within these collections for ones of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding Blogs on Message Boards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Internet users rely on message boards to find interesting and informative blogs. This is because many message board participants who have a blog often find ways to make others aware of this blog. This may either be through the process of incorporating a link to the blog in the message board users signature or, when appropriate, supplying the link to the blog directly in the message body of a post on the message board. Although many bloggers may take advantage of the opportunity to promote their own blog through message boards, those who are interested in finding new blogs will likely not have time to review all of these blogs. Therefore, it is wise for these Internet users to be somewhat discriminating about the blogs they choose to visit. One way to do this is to only visit blogs of regular forum posters who offer valuable information to the conversations on the message board. The Internet user may also wish to avoid blogs which appear to be posted as spam. This is important because these blogs are not only likely poor quality but also visiting these blogs only encourages the blog owner to continue to spam message boards with his link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking Recommendations for Blogs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Internet users who are seeking blogs to read on a regular basis can consider seeking recommendations from friends or family members who share a particular interest. Friends or family members who are interested in the same subject as you may already regularly read blogs relevant to this interest. Asking them for recommendations is worthwhile because they have no reason to do anything but recommend blogs they really enjoy and assume you will be interested in as well. Also, this method of finding blogs is ideal because your friends and family members likely know your tastes and expectations well and will likely steer you in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding Your Blogging Niche&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding your blogging niche should be one of the aspects of blogging which the blogger carefully considers before starting a blog. This is especially important if the blogging is being done for the purpose of financial compensation. Ideally a blog owner should select a blog subject about which they are passionate and knowledgeable. However, bloggers should also carefully consider the direct competition as well as the purpose of the blog before starting their blog. This article will discuss these considerations in greater detail in an attempt to assists bloggers in choosing a subject for a new blog. This information is applicable to both bloggers who are completely new to blogging as well as experienced bloggers who are considering starting a new blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isolating Your Interests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first considerations for a new blogger is his personal interests. This is important because a blogger who is passionate and knowledgeable about a particular subject will not only have an easy time coming up with ideas for new blog posts but will also likely be highly successful. This success will likely be attributable to the fact that blog visitors can sense his passion for the subject matter and greatly appreciate the knowledgeable posts which are informative and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interests of the blogger may run the gamut from subjects which are widely popular to subjects which are of interest to only a small subset of the population. However, there will likely be interested readers regardless of the subject of the blog. Therefore bloggers are not discouraged from opting to blog about even the most obscure subjects. However, bloggers who are seeking financial gain through high blog traffic should consider selecting a topic which appeals to a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating the Competition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a blogger has selected one or more subjects he is considering for a blog, it is time to begin evaluating the competition. This includes viewing other blogs covering the same subject matter. This will not only give the blogger a good indication of whether or not the market is already saturated with blogs on this subject and the quality of the existing blogs on this subject. Based on this information the blogger can make an informed decision about whether or not he feels capable of competing for blog traffic with the existing blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the Purpose of the Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important consideration for bloggers is the purpose of the blogs. Blogs can be created for a variety of reasons including financial compensation, personal use or to promote a cause. Bloggers who are starting a blog for personal use may only wish to consider their own interests when starting a blog because they are not likely seeking high blog traffic. However, bloggers who are creating a blog for purposes of generating a profit or promoting a cause do have to consider factors such as the ability to generate blog traffic. In these cases the blogger should choose a subject which appeals to a large audience. Additionally, the Internet should not already be saturated with blogs on this subject because it will likely be difficult for the new blog to garner a share of blog traffic. Finally, blog owners should consider the quality of the blog they are capable of creating on a particular subject. The blogger should choose a subject where he is confident he can not only make regular posts but also ensure these posts are original, informative and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving the Search Engine Rankings of Your Blog&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloggers who are interested in reaching a large audience with their blog should consider paying special attention to search engine optimization of their blog. Reaching a large audience may be a priority for a number of different reasons. One of the obvious reasons to attempt to generate increased traffic to a blog is to generate a profit. Bloggers who rely on high blog traffic for their revenue are obviously interested in increasing traffic. However, bloggers who create their blog to promote a cause may also be interested in increasing traffic simply to allow their message to reach a larger audience. Regardless of the reason to want to increase traffic, one of the best ways to do this is by optimizing the blog for search engines. This article will discuss the importance of search engine rankings and offer tips for optimizing a blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Search Engine Rankings are Important&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance of high search engine rankings is they can contribute to increased Internet traffic to the blog. This is because Internet users who use search engines to find information on a particular topic are much more likely to visit websites which appear on the first page of the search results than they are to visit websites which appear on subsequent pages of the search results. The websites appearing on the first page of the results are likely to get the most traffic. However, Internet users are not likely to search through more than a page or two of the search results when looking for more information on a particular subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High search engine rankings essentially act as free advertisement for a blog or website. This is because many website users rely on popular search engines to assist them in finding useful information on the Internet. The search engines apply complex algorithms to evaluate websites and rank them accordingly for specific search terms. As a result Internet users put a great deal of value on the search results produced and trust these results to lead them to the best available websites relevant to the keywords they specified in the search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tips for Optimizing a Blog for Search Engines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common ways to optimize a blog or website for search engines is through the use of relevant keywords. Specifically the practice of applying specific keyword densities to the content of the blog is a common search engine optimization tactic employed. Blog owners and others who attempt to optimize their websites do not always agree on the optimal density for keywords but many believe a percentage of approximately 2%-3% is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another method for optimizing a search engine optimization is to place relevant keywords into the code of the website. This includes the title tags and META tags. This is important because search engines often consider the prominence of keywords when evaluating a website. This refers to the location in which the keywords first appear. Placing keywords early in the content of the website is helpful but it is important to note the search engines view the code first so keywords appearing before the body of the blog will be crawled first by the search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blog owners can also help to increase their search engine rankings by generating back links to their blog. This can be accomplished in a number of different ways. One way to do this is to find other websites willing to place a link to the blog on their website. This is beneficial because many search engines factor the number of links to a website into their ranking algorithm because these links are considered to be one website vouching for the validity of another website. Some website owners may be willing to do this in return for a link to their website on your blog. This is known as reciprocal linking and some search engines may not value this link as highly as a link which is not reciprocated. There are also some link exchange programs but these links may not be beneficial because many search engines consider the rank of the website linking to your blog. Therefore, if the website linking to your blog does not rank well, the back link will not improve search engine rankings significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pandangan Islam tentang kucing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Viral mengenai surat edaran Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Surabaya soal kawasan bebas dari kucing liar.
Kucing-kucing ini dinilai mengganggu tamu kampus. Dalam sebuah penelitian yang dilakukan oleh Pete Marra selaku kepala Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, kucing juga dianggap bisa merusak ekosistem karena membuat spesies burung menjadi punah&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Padahal kucing ialah hewan yang menyenangkan dan memiliki wajah lucu. Tak jarang kucing juga memiliki sifat yang manja. Sejak zaman Rasulullah SAW, kucing disebut-sebut sebagai hewan kesayangan Nabi Muhammad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ada sebuah hadist dari Abu Qotadah, Nabi SAW bersabda:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Kucing itu tidaklah najis. Sesungguhnya kucing ialah hewan yang sering kita jumpai dan berada di sekeliling kita.” (HR. At Tirmidzi, Abu Daud, An Nasa’i, Ibnu Majah, Ad Darimi, Ahmad, Malik.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bahkan Rasulullah saking senang dan sayang dengan kucing. Beliau pernah membiarkan seekor kucing menyelesaikan menikmati minumnya di bejana yang berisi air padahal beliau hendak berwudhu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dikutip dalam buku berjudul “Hak-hak yang Wajib Anda Ketahui dalam Islam” oleh Syaikh Muhammad Hassan, diceritakan ada seorang wanita dimasukkan ke neraka gara gara menyekap kucing dan tidak memberinya makan. Wanita ini juga tidak membiarkan kucing itu makan serangga-serangga tanah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dari Ibnu Umar RA Nabi Muhammad SAW bersabda, “Seorang wanita dimasukkan ke dalam neraka karena seekor kucing yang dia ikat dan tidak dibiarkan makan bahkan tidak diperkenankan makan binatang-binatang kecil yang ada di lantai.” (HR Bukhari, Kitab Ahadits Al-Anbiya, 3467; Muslim, Kitab As-Salam, 2245)&lt;/p&gt;
