        <title>Google Search News (Jan ‘21) - crawling &amp; indexing updates, link building, and more</title>
        <description>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zrBlagfK7M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to the Google Search News Series.
I hope life is treating you reasonably well wherever
you are.
I’m your host today, John Mueller, here from Switzerland.
With this show, we want to give you
a regular summary of what’s been happening around Google Search,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;specifically for website owners, publishers, and SEOs.
If you find these useful, which I hope you do,
and if you’d like to stay up-to-date,
then make sure to subscribe to the channel.
I hope your year both ended well and is starting off well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a unique year it was, right?
If you’re watching this in the far future,
then first off, congratulations for making it that far.
And secondly, as you can see, in early 2021,
we’re still recording from home in Switzerland.
In this episode, we’ll be covering some neat new things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;around the foundation of Search, namely crawling
and indexing as well as another relevant part of Search,
namely links.
If you’re curious to find out more, then stay tuned.
As a bit of background, crawling is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when Googlebot looks at pages on the web following
the links that it sees there to find other web pages.
Indexing, the other part, is when Google systems
try to process and understand the content on those pages.
Both of these processes have to work together,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the barrier between them can sometimes be a bit fuzzy.
Let’s start with news about crawling.
While we’ve been crawling the web for decades,
there’s always something that we’re working on
to make it easier, faster, or better understandable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for site owners.
In Search Console, we recently launched an updated crawl stats
report.
Google Search Console is a free tool
that you can use to access information
on how Google Search sees and interacts with your website.
This report gives site owners information on how
Googlebot crawls the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report covers the number of requests by response code
and the crawl purposes, host-level information
on accessibility, examples, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this is also in a server’s access logs,
but getting and understanding them is often hard.
We hope this report makes it easier for sites of all sizes
to get actionable insights into the habits of Googlebot.
Together with this tool, we also launched a new guide&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;specifically for large websites and crawling.
As a site grows, crawling can become harder,
so we compiled the best practices to keep in mind.
You don’t have to run a large website to find
this guide useful, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll add a link in the description if you’re keen.
And finally, still on the topic of crawling,
we’ve started crawling with HTTP 2.
HTTP 2 is an updated version of the protocol
used to access web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has some improvements that are particularly
relevant for browsers, and we’ve been
using it to improve our normal crawling, too.
We’ve sent out messages to websites
that we’re crawling with HTTP 2 and plan to add more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;over time if things go well.
As you can see, there’s still room for news in something
as foundational as crawling.
And now, let’s move on to indexing.
As mentioned before, indexing is a process
of understanding and storing the content of web pages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so that we can show them in the search results appropriately.
For indexing, I have two items of news
to share with you today.
First, requesting indexing in the URL inspection tool
is back in Search Console.
You can once again manually submit individual pages&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to request indexing if you run into a situation
where that’s useful.
For the most part, sites should not need to use these systems
and instead focus on providing good internal linking
and good site map files.
If a site does those well, then Google systems
will be able to crawl and index content from the website
quickly and automatically.
Secondly, in Search Console, we’ve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;updated the Index Coverage Report significantly.
With this change, we’ve worked to help site owners
to be better informed on issues that
affect the indexing of their site’s content.
For example, we’ve removed the somewhat generic crawl&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anomaly issue type and replaced it
with more specific error types.
There’s a bit more about this update
in our blog post, which I’ve linked in the description
below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I mentioned links in the beginning.
Google uses links to find new pages
and to better understand their context in the web.
Next to links, we use a lot of different factors in Search,
but links are an integral part of the web,
so it’s reasonable that sites think about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s guidelines mention various things
to avoid with regards to links, such as buying them.
And we often get questions about what
sites can do to attract links.
Recently, I ran across a fascinating article from
[? Gisele ?] [? Novaro ?] on content and link building&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;campaigns that she saw last year.
While I obviously can’t endorse any particular company that
worked on these campaigns, I thought
they were great examples of what sites can do.
It’s worth taking a look at these
and thinking about some creative things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that you might be able to do in your site’s niche.
I added a link in the description below.
Creating awesome content isn’t always easy,
but it can help you to reach a broader audience and who knows,
maybe get a link or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just a short note on news about structured data.
As we mentioned in one of the previous episodes,
we’ve decided to deprecate the old structured Data Testing
tool and to focus on the rich results test in Search Console.
The good news is that the structured Data Testing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tool isn’t going away but rather finding a new home
in the schema.org community.
And that’s all for now, folks.
In closing, I’d love to hear more news from you all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;especially around this video series.
Which parts did you find particularly useful?
Which parts less so?
What should we focus on more for this year?
Please let me know in the comments
below or drop me a note on Twitter.
I really appreciate all feedback, yours, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you’d like to see more of these episodes
or catch up on the new series for sustainable monetized
websites, make sure to subscribe to the channel.
I look forward to seeing you all again
in one of the future episodes of Google Search News.
Bye.google search news by date&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>10 Aturan Emas Untuk Kencan Online yang Sukses.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Seperti yang diketahui semua orang, metode favorit kawin dan kencan untuk lajang di seluruh dunia adalah bergabung dengan situs kencan online. Tetapi yang tidak disadari kebanyakan orang adalah bahwa hanya sekitar 10% anggota situs kencan yang benar-benar bertemu dengan mitra jangka panjang di situs pilihan mereka dan 70% kekalahan bahkan tidak menerima satu pesan pun dari anggota lain. Jika Anda mengikuti 10 langkah sederhana yang diuraikan di bawah ini, Anda juga dapat bergabung dengan 10% orang yang menemukan cinta dan romansa secara online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pilih situs yang tepat. Booming dalam kencan online telah memberikan banyak pilihan bagi konsumen, tetapi Anda harus meluangkan beberapa saat untuk memutuskan jenis pasangan yang Anda cari, belum lagi kota atau kota tempat Anda ingin dia berada. . Ada situs niche yang melayani semua sektor (orang tua tunggal, pengendara sepeda motor, kaum gay, dll.) Dan situs umum yang menyambut semua pendatang seperti halnya situs dan situs khusus kota atau negara dengan perspektif global. Memilih situs yang tepat untuk Anda mungkin merupakan keputusan paling penting yang akan Anda buat saat mencari mitra secara online.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Pilih nama pengguna yang bagus. Kesan pertama selalu terakhir dan identitas online yang Anda berikan kepada diri Anda sendiri adalah hal pertama yang akan dilihat anggota lain sebelum mereka memeriksa profil Anda. Karya ‘lucu’, ‘samar’ berfungsi dan Anda tidak akan melakukan kesalahan jauh bahkan jika Anda memutuskan untuk menggunakan nama kristen Anda sendiri; tetapi jika Anda memilih cara yang cabul atau menjurus ke arah seksual (yang tampaknya dilakukan oleh banyak pria), Anda akan menemukan bahwa anggota lain akan memberi Anda tempat yang luas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unggah foto. Ini penting karena sebagian besar orang hanya mencari anggota yang mau repot memasukkan foto; Anda ingin melihat seperti apa penampilan anggota lain sehingga masuk akal bahwa orang lain akan merasakan hal yang sama tentang Anda. Jika satu-satunya foto yang Anda miliki tidak terlalu bagus, Anda selalu dapat menyebutkannya di profil Anda - masih lebih baik daripada tidak ada foto sama sekali.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lengkapi profil Anda. Tidak ada yang lebih tidak menyenangkan daripada profil yang berteriak “Saya tidak bisa melakukan ini dengan benar”. Jika Anda tidak punya waktu untuk menyelesaikan semua kategori saat Anda mendaftar, luangkan waktu untuk melakukannya sedini mungkin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bersikaplah optimis dan positif. Jika Anda merasa sedikit sedih atau kurang percaya diri, sekarang bukan waktunya untuk mengatakannya saat Anda menulis deskripsi tentang diri Anda. Jika Anda tampil sebagai orang yang percaya diri, bahagia, dan penuh kesenangan, Anda akan mendapatkan lebih banyak perhatian daripada jika Anda tampil sebagai mono-silabic atau down dalam kesedihan. Dan ingat, humor adalah pemecah kebekuan dan afrodisiak yang hebat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Perluas kriteria pencarian Anda. Jika Anda umumnya memilih orang yang memiliki rambut pirang, mata biru dan antara 5’4 “dan 5’6” dan Anda mempersempit pencarian Anda hanya pada hal-hal spesifik ini, maka Anda mungkin kehilangan banyak anggota lain yang Anda juga akan menemukan sama menariknya. Untuk memulainya, cukup cari berdasarkan jenis kelamin, usia dan lokasi dan dengan begitu Anda akan memberi diri Anda pilihan seluas mungkin.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jangan secara otomatis mengabaikan orang. Jika Anda menerima pesan dari seseorang yang profilnya Anda sukai tetapi tidak mau repot-repot menyertakan fotonya, Anda tetap harus membalas dan meminta mereka untuk mengirimkan foto ke alamat email biasa Anda. Anda akan menemukan bahwa banyak orang lebih bersedia melakukan ini daripada memposting foto untuk dilihat semua orang.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gunakan semua fitur yang ditawarkan. Banyak situs menyediakan lebih dari sekedar sistem email internal. Beberapa situs mungkin menyertakan pesan suara sementara yang lain memungkinkan anggota untuk mengobrol dan menggoda secara ‘waktu nyata’ dengan anggota lain dan semakin Anda memanfaatkan semua yang tersedia untuk Anda, semakin besar kesempatan Anda untuk melakukan kontak dengan seseorang yang istimewa.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bersikaplah proaktif. Setelah Anda mendaftar dan melengkapi profil Anda, jangan menunggu orang lain menghubungi Anda. Saat Anda melihat seseorang yang menurut Anda cocok dengan diri Anda sendiri, tulis surat kepada mereka dan perkenalkan diri Anda. Dan jangan hanya mengatakan ‘Hai, saya suka profil Anda’, beri tahu mereka alasan Anda menulis kepada mereka dan tunjukkan kesamaan yang Anda yakini. Pesan pembuka yang panjang akan menciptakan kesan yang jauh lebih baik daripada pesan pendek yang asal-asalan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Periksa kembali situsnya. Situs kencan paling populer memiliki orang-orang baru yang bergabung setiap saat jadi ingatlah untuk masuk setidaknya sekali setiap hari untuk melihat anggota terbaru dan Anda kemudian dapat menghubungi siapa pun yang Anda sukai sebelum orang lain mendapatkan kesempatan untuk melakukannya. Selain itu, Anda harus ingat bahwa di sebagian besar situs, anggota yang paling banyak log in muncul di daftar pencarian yang lebih tinggi daripada mereka yang tidak, sehingga profil Anda akan lebih mudah dikenali oleh orang-orang yang mungkin cocok dengan Anda.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jadi begitulah - kencan online yang sukses bukanlah ilmu roket; ini hanya membutuhkan sedikit pemikiran dan sedikit usaha dan jika Anda mematuhi 10 aturan yang telah saya uraikan di atas, maka kehidupan pribadi Anda akan segera menerima permulaan yang layak.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cara mengetahui keyword blog masuk page one melalui google search console</title>
        <description>&lt;h1&gt;Keyword Blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cara mengetahui keyword blog / website masuk page one melalui google search console. Begini caranya :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yang pertama usahakan blog atau website sudah tertadaftar di web master tools atau google search console. nah pastinya kalian sdah mempunyai sebuah postingan blog atau website dan saat sudah terindex atau muncul di mesin pencarian maka data dari serach engin akan menampilkan data juga di web master seperti :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total tayang pada mesin pencarian&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Total klik keyword yang tayang di mesin pencarian&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posisi Rata Rata&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nah pada tabel di web master atau google seach console itu ada 4 tampilan meliputi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Klik&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tayangan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RTK&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Posisi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saat kalian berada di menu kinerja pada&amp;nbsp; google search console maka harus centang posisi rata rata dan nanti muncul posisi rata rata quey atau keyword yang masuk&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;umum nya posisi rata rata page one 1 - 8 ya kadang 1- 10 maximal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapi pastikan cek kapan update nya di web master tools. kalau keywods mu berada di posisi angka 1 maka sudah pasti masuk page one di nomor 1 baris 1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jika angka 6 maka masuk page one di baris 6 .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kalau posisi 8 maka page one baris 8 tapi kalau pas cek saat update bisa saja keyword itu sudah bergeser turun atau naik 😄😄😄😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simak video di bawah ini dah ya&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Fhe4pAnXCM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Do We Even Need MySpace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Myspace Layouts, Myspace Backgrounds, Myspace Codes, Myspace Graphics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are part of MySpace, and that you have plenty of friends. Besides having a lot of friends, there will also be new ones who might approach you. You can also meet a lot of acquaintances for various reasons. The profile will have to look interesting; else no one will be able to take any sort of interest in them. Imagine you have to look at the same settings for all profiles; it would be boring of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the MySpace layouts will come into the picture. You will need layouts to customize the profiles to a great extent. You can do a great job with the profiles, as there will be a lot of layouts to choose from. This will be exciting to do, as there are so many unique ones to pick from. This is not only the idea of layouts; it is also to make the concept of the profiles different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The layouts are needed for the profiles because the site is extremely popular. There are millions of users and if everyone has the same settings, it would become extremely boring. This is what the main purpose of the layouts is. You can also choose so many according to the themes that you have in mind, that there will be no shortage of layouts to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are bound to be millions of visitors on the site, having different layouts will make a huge difference. You can easily talk about your interests and specific likes through this. All you need to do is pick one, which would suit your requirements. It could be about a film star, or it could be about some sport that you are passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using specific MySpace layouts on the profiles will make you stand out from the crowd. This way, you will talk about yourself and you can also attract as many friends as you can. This will keep your profile very exciting, as the main purpose of you using the site is to network. You should not think much about using the layouts, as there will be easy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are so many themes and colors to choose from, there will be a lot of difference to the profile. You can also highlight a lot of things in the profile, by choosing the apt design as well as colors. This is what will make the profile unique. By being unique there will be so many things that you can do. You can create a number of networks based on the interests you are showcasing, using the help of layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MySpace layouts are needed for profiles, as no two profiles need look the same. When each profile looks different, the community will begin to take a new looks altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Change To Windows Vista: Part 2 of 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Windows, Vista, Windows Vista, Tennessee, Mountain Man, remote helpdesk, help desk, helpdesk, outsourced it services, remote computer repair, online computer repair, outsourced helpdesk, outsourced help desk, outsourced computer repair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Change To Windows Vista:  Part 3 of 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are almost there, this is part 3 of 4.  Actually it has somewhat more meat than Part 2, but once again starts trailing off towards the last few reasons covered by the Tennessee Mountain Man today.  Computer man can’t help but wonder if a third grader actually did prepare Microsoft’s reasons to smile or upgrade to Vista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#51. “Because you live to play”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Mountain Man actually wishes Microsoft had this one right for the average American.  But, alas Americans play less than the citizenry of most other countries.  Outsourced computer repair techs, unlike the money moguls at Microsoft, recognizes it now takes two people working not only full time but over time to feed and clothe the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because we love to play”, may have been more accurate; but living to play?  Americans have long proven their propensity to live for work unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote helpdesk 1 is the proof in the pudding!  Who has time for computer games?  As to whether Windows Vista makes the games easier, faster, more fun….give me a break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#52. “ Take control of game time”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos !!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#53. “Because you can get more done when you work together”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s brain storming appears to have produced great and long followed general rules for success in any endeavor.&lt;br /&gt;
“The house divided against itself cannot stand”.  Mutual cooperation on the job, in sports, or in family affairs goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As to inviting people to work with you on projects over the Internet, a company network, or an ad-hoc wireless network….We had been doing that for years… long before Windows XP was corrupted to come up with Windows Vista simply to enrich Microsoft coffers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#54. “Stay entertained wherever you go”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these remind old online computer repair geezers of some of the motel ads on TV.  Come On!!!!!!!!!!  Wow!  Online helpdesk would have never thought of that little trick before Vista and without the help of Bill Gates!  N E X T !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#55. “Because success tomorrow starts today”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen!!!!! Today is the first day of the rest of your life, but P L E A S E  get a life.  Hopefully not after Microsoft’s blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this reason, like most of their reasoning, appears to be little more than someone “making work” or needing to fill newspaper space.  Speaking of needing to get a life!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#56. “Print what you see”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hogwash!!!!  Unlike the rest of mankind, apparently Microsoft never heard of Windows 3 or the “print screen” command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#57. “Because you don’t need a PC to watch your home movies”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really?  Can you say Kodak?  How about Polaroid?  Well, don’t!  Outsourced it services still needs the online pc repair work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#58. “Fill your home with music”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, please!  Music soothes the savage beast!  Maybe Microsoft needs something besides elevator music, however.
We used to do that with a radio which had a red light that burned when the radio was on.  As a lad the Tennessee Mountain Man used to set for hours with an eye glued to that light watching radio shows.  Those were the days!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dacomputerman knows all about that! That was all before WMP 11 and Microsoft’s control over his entertainment choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#59. “Make a masterpiece”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Blend your photos and home videos into a rich movie experience, complete with soundtrack, titles and credits, and creative transitions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Microsoft can report you!  You do know, they know what you had for dinner last evening and whether you skipped breakfast this morning, don’t you?  Listen….sounds like they are the phone with an artist formerly known as Prince now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#60. “Because you want your video memories to stay true to life”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Windows Movie Maker lets you retain high-definition quality as you capture, edit, and publish movies from your HD camcorder.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remote computer repair folks told me this is “déjà vu all over again”.  Dacomputerman thought he was just getting old and senile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and don’t forget this little ditty:  “Some product features are only available in certain editions of Windows Vista and may require advanced or additional hardware”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#61. “Stand strong against hackers”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The easy-to-use Windows Firewall with Advanced Security provides advanced protection to help shield you and your PC from malicious attacks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come on…come on!  Stop laughing and get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#62. “Because it remembers what you like to doand helps you do it faster”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please refer to MS#59 above!  Then go immediately to the Prefetch File located in C:\Windows and dump it’s contents.  Do this daily and note the improvement in OS response time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#63. “Help is always available”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now most people have learned to avoid the helpdesk of major computer companies including Microsoft…maybe especially Microsoft and certainly especially if your first language is English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately also most people ignore the recommendation in this reasoning.  Otherwise a lot of us would be out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#64. “Keep your files confidential”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you say, déjà vu once again?  Swamp land, anyone?  anyone?  how about a bridge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#65 “Send a fax on the spot”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Windows Fax and Scan makes sending and receiving faxes directly from your PC as simple as using e-mail. With fax templates linked to your address book, it’s easy to retrieve a fax number, attach your documents, and just click to send.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos!!!!!!  someone caught sleeping?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#66. “Because everyone goofs sometimes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never heard of restore points before Vista ,huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#67. “Because e-mail is your lifeline”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#68. “Stay on top of your family’s schedule”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old magnet on the refrigerator didn’t work, I doubt this will.  But maybe it will work better for you than for the old da computer man,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#69. “Because you want the quality of your printouts to match the quality of your work”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K.  Kudos!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#70. “Your PC is ready when you are”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is your significant other!!  Right.  Just keep the aspirin handy…headaches do happen! And, don’t miss the standard little caveat at the end of the reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#71. “Keep your favorite things at your fingertips”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite things have nothing to do with computers or Windows Vista.
Please excuse the computer man while he day dreams a bit.  Favorite things…O.K. unmentionable.  So move on to Meerschaum pipe, BCA smoking tobacco, Scotch, T Bone, Lobster….alright…alright…moving along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#72. “Get the latest news delivered right to your desktop”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;schhhhhhh!  Please don’t tell Microsoft that these news tickers have been around forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#73. “Because your photos and home movies don’t have to be stuck in your PC anymore”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ho!  hum!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#74. “Because your memories need a little mood music”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times and ways can we say, déjà vu?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#75. “Because you want professional-looking photos from your own printer”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, How many times can you take, déjà vu?  If only Microsoft had considered that question!!

        <title>Why Change To Windows Vista:  Part 3 of 4</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Windows, Vista, Windows Vista, Tennessee, Mountain Man, remote helpdesk, help desk, helpdesk, outsourced it services, remote computer repair, online computer repair, outsourced helpdesk, outsourced help desk, outsourced computer repair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why Change To Windows Vista: Part 2 of 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having caught his breath and dispatched the laugh monster (just in time for Halloween) the Tennessee Mountain Man is ready to resume his look at Microsoft’s 100 Reasons Why we should be using Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Part 1 of Why Change To Windows Vista, Remote Helpdesk 1, examined Microsoft’s reasons 1 through 25.  Today we will cover reasons 26 - 50 so lets get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#26. “Because you’re a multitasker”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Scientific studies reveal the hidden costs of multitasking as technology increasingly tempts people to do more than one thing at a time Bill Gates and Microsoft keep pushing for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone were tempting Microsoft employees to use anything other than best practices there would be one of Microsoft’s infamous law suits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aren’t all of us forced to multi task toooo much as it is?  Back off Gates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#27. “ Because your computer can keep up with you while you’re on the go”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lik
e the pager and the cell phone, the curse of the hand held, laptop, note book and other portables is that all technology, including our computers, have kept up with us too well…no uninterrupted vacations, dinners, shows, golf games, or romantic sessions.  Get this contraption out of my bedroom!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#28. “Enjoy your memories, larger than life”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, The Tennessee Mountain Man finds nothing new here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#29. “Take the handwritten approach”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K. Been around forever.  Ever checked out at the store or used an ATM with a touch screen?  How about Monday Night Football?  Been there, done that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#30. “Restore your PC in an instant”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!  I know I am not as smart as the Microsoft gurus but haven’t that covered this already, in Part 1 maybe?!  I guess that is why he is Bill Gates owning Microsoft and I own a remote helpdesk performing online computer repair services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the army we taught by telling students what we were going to teach them, doing the teaching, and then reiterating what we had told them.  But, we didn’t try to cover it up calling it three different lectures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S.  Don’t miss their last caveat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#31. “Because your PC lets you know if something’s wrongand helps you fix it”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, The Tennessee Mountain Man could find nothing new here either unless the user has been more lazy than most.  It was all available with earlier, faster, less expensive, and less intrusive operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Tennessee Mountain Man is in danger of becoming repetitive, but Microsoft is not giving me anything to work with here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#32. “Streamline IT management across your business”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh!!!!! So!!!!!!! It is actually just an upgrade Microsoft Server 2003 with all the patches and fixes included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#33. “Preserve a lifetime of memories”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a back up feature!!!!  Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#34. “Connect to the network at work or school”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention connecting at your motel, Mickey D’s, your grand ma’s, and a million other places.  Kids and businessmen have been doing this for years…Next!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#35. “Because you’ll know it when you see it”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we haven’t seen it yet….moving right along….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#36. “Get a “do-over” when you need it”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I have some swamp property I need to unload before you lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#37. “Keep your info under lock and key”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be the best reason so far. But, let’s face it, if Microsoft and the U.S. Government can’t keep hackers out of their own stuff do you really think you have a chance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, have you lost the pass words to get into today’s IBM laptops?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#38. “It’s the cure for red-eye”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, they were not brazen enough to say it would keep you from working nights.  What they are doing is touting an existing technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#39. “Relive your memorieseach and every one”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K. Microsoft likes to be redundant, remote computer repair services does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#40. “Because you love what you do”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially when the windows operating don’t crash or lock up, and performs more reliably like Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But watch Microsoft’s caveat at the end of this reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#41. “Because your PC will stay up to date, automatically”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has it not done that for years?   Oh, yes, I’m sorry.  The Tennessee Mountain Man almost forgot.  This is apparently our warning that Microsoft will come through the back door and make any changes they want whenever they wish despite our desires and upgrade and maintenance settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#42. “E-mail your photos without worrying about the file size”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, really?  The ISP on each end of the spectrum may have different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#43. “It’s parent friendly”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is that supposed to mean?  It is slow?  Because it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry they are referring to parental controls like the ones parents and bosses have used forever.  Got it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#44. “Because you have a need for speed”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Need to speed up your computer? Simply plug a USB memory stick into your desktop or notebook computer and let Windows ReadyBoost do the rest.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O.K., I could, but I won’t.  Kudos!!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#45. “Because you hate all those boxes and wires”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why we had already eliminated them…..next…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#46. “Your music can look as good as it sounds”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Branson maybe!  Now just what does this do that is an improvement over XP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#47. “Let the fun start now”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we having fun yet?  No!!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#48. “Stay connected wherever you go”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duh!!!!!!  We just covered this subject!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#49. “Take your workspace with you”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft remains redundant, I can’t help but respond….The labor laws of the U.S. makes provisions for breaks and meal times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to get away on occasion and Microsoft wants a robot chasing me around demanding more…more…more…more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS#50. “Get more out of the web”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch the caveat as Microsoft makes a johnny come lately feeble attempt to catch up with other browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the Tennessee Mountain Man speechless yet?  No, but we’ll take another stab at it tomorrow with “Why Change To Windows Vista:  Part 3 of 4”.

        <title>Why Are Many Colors Used With Myspace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Myspace is the only online community, which offers various options for layouts. Since it is a very large community with millions of users, there are bound to be expectations for the kind of presentations with the layouts. Myspace layouts are available for free, and they are used by all members of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are designed by various designers and the concepts vary, but they are all upgraded to the sites as often as possible. They are categorized according to the themes, so that it is easy for any user to pick the layout that he wants. Many hundreds of colors with various color combinations are used with Myspace layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because people want to break the monotony of the use of the same layouts again and again. Since most communities normally have default settings, users are bound to get bored with the outlook of the profile. With Myspace too, the default settings get boring for all the millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be solved with the variety of the Myspace layouts. All the colors used with these layouts are versatile, and so are the combinations. The number of colors available is innumerable as well, and all users have a variety of choice. By using these various colors, the entire outlook of the profile will change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colors are also picked according to the theme of the profile. Not only do they make the profile colorful, sometimes the colors will blend so well with the theme, that it makes the whole thing very interesting. Users will thus never get bored of visiting profiles. They will be offered a variety of colors to look at, and they will be pleasing to the eye as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various colors also offer a scope to be creative, and they can use them as they please. All Myspace layouts available on all sites are completely free of cost and will be of complete variety as well. There is also no end to the number of colors being used with these layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will be of all sorts and shades, and will suit any requirement of the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members can pick themes with various colors, according to what they have written on the profile. For example, if they are fans of witchcraft, they may use foreboding colors, and if they are fans of cartoons, they may use peppy colors. All this depends on how they want to project the profile as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Myspace layouts is really exciting as there are so many to choose from. Members may keep changing every week if they want, or according to their convenience. This allows for a very interesting activity, as the profile gets different looks often. You need not be technical wizards to use these layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Are Laptop Batteries So Bad?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are like most people with laptops you know that they are only as portable as the nearest outlet. The companies advertise like their laptop batteries make these machines so that they can go anywhere with you and there will be no problem but there is a problem. You only have a couple hours max of normal word processing type use and then you are toast unless you either have a backup battery or you can plug in somewhere and recharge. The other problem is that lots of places that you go and that you would love to use a laptop at aren�t able to supply outlets to everyone and so you are up a creek as they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my main question for this piece is why are laptop batteries so bad? To answer this question I am going to do a quick search on the internet and try to quickly glean as much information as I can in the next few minutes and then I will proceed to pack it in to the next 2 paragraphs or so. Here I go�.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well we will start with what most batteries are made of and that is Lithium Ion cells (older laptop batteries were made of nickel cadmium). These batteries have several advantages including no memory and no scheduled cycling (That does not mean however that it is a good idea to repeatedly run your battery dead). These batteries are therefore low maintenance. However because their cell oxidation can not be reversed through cycling there is a definite and short lifespan for these batteries. This turns out to be around two to three years and is not necessarily lengthened by not using as oxidation goes on in the form of self discharge even when stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is recommended that one stores the battery at about 40% capacity and in a cool place. The 40% capacity gives it the ability to self discharge slowly without going all the way dead (which is bad for these laptop batteries, if you recall). These batteries will oxidize more slowly in cooler temperatures which prolongs the life. These power cells are not meant for long term storage as already mentioned because the self discharge will drain it sometimes to the point of no return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why these new laptop batteries are so much more expensive than they used to be is because they require an internal circuit that prevents it from overcharging. Overcharging can cause the battery to heat up and actually burst into flames.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Should Use Myspace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with the Internet, you are most likely to have an account on MySpace. This is an exciting online community, which allows people to have free memberships. You can post the profile for free, and there are many options available for this community. There are free MySpace layouts available for all members to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone having an account on this site should use MySpace layouts. These layouts come with various themes as well as colors, and all members will find what they want. Some may wonder why they should apply new layouts when there are already default settings on the site. However using MySpace layouts will give a completely new look and feel to the profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any member on this site should take some effort and should try and find a good layout that will suit their profile. Trying to match the profile with some good layout is very important. This is because it will speak volumes about the person�s interests and also outlook towards their presence on the community. Members could be present for networking in various groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus a member should try and pick an appropriate layout for his profile. MySpace layouts are probably the simplest techniques that one can follow with any site creation. Each one has a code, and the code has to be copy pasted on to the profile homepage and it is immediately updated. Within a few seconds the profile is sporting a new look and it will make it all the more interesting to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the greatest benefit for those using MySpace layouts. They may not only access these for free, they can apply it very easily. Even if you are a fan of a Hollywood movie star, you can find that layout on some site. All you need to do is hunt for it in the right way and on the right site. If all members use the MySpace layouts that are available on the sites, then they would make the whole community more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are always navigating through sites, and looking for new friends. When they access profiles, and they find a layout that they like, they are sure to even apply it to their own profiles. However that is not the main part of MySpace layouts. It is to provide a lot of creativity to the profiles, and also allow the members to get as versatile as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is not a compulsion for users to pick MySpace layouts, it is always better for people to use a variety. It would make a huge difference from default settings, as the themes available are simply astounding. Designers are constantly coming up with various layouts, so that members will be satisfied. The variety will allow the members to have a fine time, what with the choosing and applying.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Who Posts Free MySpace Layouts?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of free MySpace layouts on the Internet. They are used specifically for the site, and almost all members try to be a part of these layouts by picking them. Though there are so many layouts available, there is always the doubt whether these layouts are free or not. Many sites have been dedicated to the free MySpace layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways today with which someone can promote a site. Thus many of these sites related to free layouts for MySpace will also get promotion. This is because they will use various methods to advertise, and they will also get a lot of advertisements on the sites as well. There are many designers who create these layouts and post them for free on various sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since MySpace is very popular on the Internet, these designers know that they will be allowed to post many free MySpace layouts. They will post as many as they can, and they are also coming out with a lot of designs every day. Most sites are being updated with the free layouts almost every day. This means that there are many designers on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who are interested in designing layouts will do so, and they will post them on sites. This is also an interesting concept, because we get to see the creativity of many designers. They will choose to pick various themes, and they will also bring out a lot of new things that members have never seen. This will keep the members happy, as they are getting a lot of variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at the popularity of the free MySpace layouts, designers are coming up with various designs often. Each one is competing as well, and this makes it all the more exciting. This allows for a lot of challenge in the creativity of the layouts, as there will be room for many themes. Designers could be anyone, and just about anyone who is interested in posting free MySpace layouts can do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accessibility to these sites is also very easy, and one can pick free MySpace layouts anytime they want. They can also choose the design of anyone. They will be posted according to the categories, and they will not be used for any other site other than MySpace. These designers have only one goal, and that is to make the members satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do this by coming up with highly innovative themes, even such as cartoons and various other interesting topics. These designers always try to keep their work very challenging, as they will try to keep improving each time they post a free layout. Users must make as much use as possible, as the free MySpace layouts are very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
