    "body": "2021/01/27 - Adware is one of many “malwares” or malicious software programs that are unknowingly installed on your computer when you visit online sites and download freebies. When you use share files or visit sites with free downloads of wallpaper, videos, or music, some of these sites will send along adware software with your download. These malwares are a rapidly growing threat to all computer systems. It is estimated that in the first three months of 2005 over 80% of computer users had some type of malware software program running on their computer, without their knowledge. Although it is much less a threat to your computer and information than spyware is, what adware will do is cause pop up banners and advertisements to appear on your computer. These advertisements are displayed on your computer no matter what program you might be using. What the people who place this type of nuisance software on you computer say is that adware advertising helps them to recover costs and allows them to offer you those freebies you want. What you want to do to stop adware from appearing on your computer is to first run an anti-adware program. Run this program on demand regularly. Along with an anti-adware software program run your regular computer virus scan on demand also. Check the security level on your computer. You security level setting should be at least medium to help protect you from unwanted downloads. Do not download free files from the internet, period. When downloading any software read the end-user license agreement. Some of these agreements will state that when you download their software you are also agreeing to accept a downloaded spyware that may be placed on your computer at the same time. Be aware of threats to your computer, and your personal information. THOUSANDS QUALITY but FREE PLR ARTICLES @ www.

The blackboard has been replaced by the whiteboard. Users write with dry-wipe pens instead of chalk. The pens come in about eight colors. Dry wipe pens leave marks that can simply be erased using a duster or clean board duster. The pens do leave a powdery residue when the board is wiped clean. Using dry wipe pens is considerably more expensive than chalk, but much less messy. Whiteboards also make excellent additions to home offices, kitchens and garages. Jot your notes, to do tasks and phone messages on the whiteboard and they will never be lost, as pieces of paper will be. A whiteboard will allow you to prioritise all the tasks associated with running a business from home. Planning is made much easier, too. My Internet business revolves around my white-boards. Whiteboards come in a wide range of sizes, though the common sizes are 3 feet by 4 feet and 6 feet by 4 feet. Buy the biggest one you can fit on your wall space, because you will manage to fill it much faster than you think. You may have to buy from a specialist office supplier, like Viking Direct, because high street stores are often limited in the stock they carry. Interactive whiteboards are another ball game entirely. An interactive board will cost hundreds of dollars, as opposed to a dry wipe plastic board that only has a cost of thirty dollars or so. An interactive board allows users to use special non-marking pens that appear to write on the surface, but the board clears when the computer attached to the whiteboard is switched off. The interactive board comes into its own when it is used with specially designed software that allows users to project spreadsheets onto the board, then draw on the board with special “pens”, that leave a colored mark on the board, which disappears when the PC is turned off. There is really no mark there at all. "

    "title": "Which is which; Cheap Laptop or Cheap Desktop?",
    "body": "2021/01/27 - :printing Should you buy a cheap laptop or a cheap desktop? You may find yourself asking that question many times while shopping for a computer. This guide offers you the pros and cons of owning a laptop versus a desktop pc.  Processing speedComparing processing speeds, laptops usually lag behind their desktop counterparts. With the rapid advance in microchip technology, the gap between them will become smaller.  Wireless. Most laptops especially those with Intel mobile chips come with wireless capability out of the box. This means you can get online from any location at home easily without ugly wires if you have a wireless network setup at home. Desktop pcs do not typically provide this capability out of the box although that may change in the near future.  Memory. Memory chip tends to be more expensive in Laptop than desktop pcs. If you buy a laptop with less than 512MB ram, be prepare to pay more for memory upgrades than you have to with a desktop pc.  Graphics DisplayBecause of the size of a laptop, most business or entry level laptop use integrated graphics with limited ram. This means most laptops even some expensive ones cannot run graphics intensive applications or 3d games as well as a desktop pc. With a desktop pc, you can buy a dedicated graphics card just to serve a graphics intensive application.  Portability. Portability is why everyone wants a laptop these days. Because of their size and weight, it is easier to carry a laptop around as opposed to a desktop pc.  Screen Display. Everyone buy laptop for their portability so laptops usually do not come with screens as big as their desktop counterparts. The screen technology used is usually not as good as those used by desktop pc. Furthermore with a desktop pc, you can always upgrade to a bigger and better screen whereas for laptop you are stuck with the same screen display for the whole lifespan of the laptop. So whether you should buy a cheap laptop or a cheap desktop, ask yourself what are your needs? If you want to be able to use a computer wherever you go, then you are looking at a laptop to fulfill your needs. However if you do not require the portability of a laptop, play a lot of 3D games, graphic intensive applications, if you care about upgradeability to prolong the lifespan of your investment, then desktop pc is a smarter choice for you.

    "body": "2021/01/27 - dream, dreams, dreamers, john kennedy, bobby kennedy, martin l king, gipper, robert kennedy, teacher, pastor, leader When the Tennessee Mountain Man was a young man, there were dream girls.  Girls like Liz Taylor, Raquel Welch, Marilyn Monroe, Diana Ross, Nancy Sinatra, Tina Turner and the Vargas girls.  Man, we even thought Dale Evans, Annie Oakley, Miss Kitty, Della Street, and the girl next door were hot… probably a hormone thing. But, there were also dreamers.  Dreamers like John Kennedy who had a dream that challenged and inspired a new generation.  Dreamers like Martin Luther King, Jr. who had a dream that changed a nation.  Bobby Kennedy had a dream.  The Gipper had a dream. Then there were the dream makers… dream makers like school teachers who challenged you to be all you could be, professionals like lawyers and doctors who practiced their skills primarily because they cared for their fellow man often for a pound of butter, a dozen fresh farm eggs, a chicken for the dinner table, or a gallon of fresh churned buttermilk, and there were men of God who spread the Gospel out of love for something other than numbers, pride and money.  There were local community leaders who inspired and they actually got out on the street and interacted with their citizens. The poet Langston Hughes: “Hold fast to dreams For if dreams die Life is a broken-winged bird That cannot fly. Hold fast to dreams For when dreams go Life is a barren field Frozen with snow. ” Where are the Dr Kildare’s that dare challenge one to a noble service bigger than themselves rather than seeking self aggrandizement? Where is America’s future? Where are all the dream inspiring TV shows and actual road trips like Route 66? Where are real cars that people can fall in love with? Where are all the road side stands where a child’s imagination could be driven for hours without anything being stolen or broken? Where have all the dreamers gone? Where have the dream makers gone? Why are those who started with nothing but a dream now setting comfortably in their million dollar homes sipping brandy in the evening and ensconced in their ivory towers by day while dreamers disappear from the landscape? Who do they think will inspire a new generation to dream, to dare if they don’t? What we have been given, what we have accomplished comes with a price which cannot be abdicated.  The dream, the inspiration must be passed to a new generation.  They must strive for a new frontier. Oh, community pride, community love, community care, 4-H Clubs, Boy Scouts, FFA, school plays and cake walks where art thou? The Computerman don’t see his grandchildren pursuing any of these things or dreaming about what could be.  We have not arrived by a long shot.  Where is the next generation and what will it accomplish? Will it add anything worthwhile to God’s earth or be self absorbed or be couch potatoes playing with the latest gizmo? Does your pastor inspire the young people, or is he or she just there to count heads and collect dollars? If it is not the former, it is time for a new pastor.  Do the teachers in your schools inspire and motivate students? If not, send them packing.  Their grossly extended vacation schedule and short hours be damned.  Let them do that for which they are best suited like slinging burgers at the Golden Arches rather than holding back our prodigy.  Do civic and political leaders lead? If not, replace them, and the sooner the better for the next generation of dreamers. Why is hanging in the hood so popular today? Why are gangs and gang bangers so prevalent? Why can’t our children dream beyond their current circumstances? We did! We wanted to be Wyatt Earp (at least the TV image), Matt Dillon, The Lawman, Perry Mason, Dr Marcus Welby, M. D. , Paladin, Pat Garrett or perhaps even the Reverend Billy Graham or the next Reverend Dr Martin Luther King or a Sister Theresa or maybe Elvis or Ricky Nelson and we enjoyed watching Lassie while wolfing down a big bowl of pop corn or home parched peanuts while we dreamed. We had to dream before we acted, before we accomplished. Before we had the answers there were the dreams. There was a dream, then there was Rosa Parks.  There was a dream, then there was John Glenn! We dreamed… we dreamed of being… we dreamed of becoming… we dreamed of serving… we dreamed of living… we dreamed of loving… we dreamed of giving… We dreamed. In the theater of our minds we slipped the surly bonds of earth and dared ponder the possibilities that lay before us. What happened? Where have all the dreamers gone? Are today’s sick, addicted, anorexic pop stars tomorrows future? Where are the dream makers? Who can capture the imagination and propel it forward through the haze of uncertainty and through the unknown into a better brighter tomorrow? Who? Where are the dream makers?! Where are the dreamers?! "

People confuse computer renting with leasing. Renting is short term in nature and is very flexible. Leasing, like buying is a fixed arrangement. You can extend the rental or cancel at any time with no penalty. Leases can’t be cancelled without a ‘severe penalty’. Renting laptops is totally flexible, requires no capital budget and can often be accomplished with a company credit card. For most companies, renting is as easy as getting office supplies. Rental companies have expert computer technicians who deliver, install and test your laptop rental right at your office, training room, trade show booth, seminar, convention or conference. Rental companies have everything you need and a backup plan if something unexpected happens. Other reasons why businesses rent laptop computers include temporary offices, traveling executives and temporary employees. Temporary OfficesTemporary offices can be made complete with rental laptop computers, printers, copiers and fax machines. The hardware will be configured to your company specifications and installed at any remote location in the United States or Canada. Rentacomputer. com has set up temporary offices in hotel rooms, trailers, warehouses and convention centers. Temporary offices have been set up for State and Federal Government agencies such as FEMA, the FBI and the IRS. Also legal firms, television networks covering hurricane disasters, movie studios setting up “on location”, and new building construction sites, corporate mergers and takeovers. Traveling ExecutivesTraveling executives won’t have to carry portable laptop computers through airports or other public transportation facilities. Executives can have technology, preconfigured and tested, waiting at their final destination! Traveling with technology is one hassle that can be easily avoided by calling a computer rental expert like a Temporary Technology Travel Agent. Temporary EmployeesTemporary employees need temporary technology. By renting laptop computers you can coordinate the installation and removal of computers, printers and other technology for any period of time specified. If you hire temporary employees, hire temporary technology too. Next time you have a temporary or special need, consider renting laptop computer technology and technical expertise.

Things like installing CD-ROM drives, sound cards and other expansion cards don’t take much computer knowledge. How can you know though when you are over your head and need professional computer help? Some computer repairs are difficult for the average person to do without causing damage to their computer or a peripheral. There are some repairs I’d classify as beginner level, some as intermediate and others as advanced. I’ve already mentioned some repairs I would call beginner level. Some intermediate repairs include replacing your hard drive and installing an operating system. There was a time when something like this was advanced but with modern Microsoft operating systems like Windows XP and Windows Vista, operating system installations are not as advanced as they used to be. So what repairs should a beginner not attempt? I would suggest some things like replacing your motherboard. The need to replace your motherboard can come either when you are ready to upgrade your motherboard to something newer or when your computer case power supply kicks the bucket. Another repair I would caution against is based in software. That’s when you need to clean out a nasty virus or spyware program. It is very easy to cause you much grief if you don’t do it right. You could lose access to the data on your hard drive if you mess up your operating system. Now if you don’t care about the data on your hard drive, simply re-installing your operating system while making sure to format your hard drive can usually solve a software problem. Kind of like killing a fly with a large shovel. It works but it is overkill. A professional computer repair technician can help you keep your data while ridding you of a virus infection. "

When I think about computers, I think about the internet, Microsoft Word (for school), and games. What sort of computer I buy should be user friendly in all three of these aspects. First you have to make a big decision… Apple or Windows. They both have great features, and are both more user friendly for each individule user. Windows is compatible with several computer manufacturers, including HP Pavilion, Compaq, and Dell. Now, in my case, I need to take a close look at each option, as I have specific uses for my machine. When purchasing a computer you should be aware of what your main purpose with it is. For some it is business, others gaming, and for many, it is used for school. Make sure you test each version, Apple and Windows. If Apple seems the most compatible with your purpose, then congradulations! Your choice is made. But if you decide Apple is not right for you, take a look at all the operating systems that there is for Windows.

    "title": "What is eSATA?",
    "body": "2021/01/27 - eSATA eSATA is an example of an extension to current serial ATA standards. The main function of eSATA is to make it possible for SATA drives to be attached externally, creating a wider network of functionality by combining the power of each of the drives.  Relatively new, eSATA means that it is possible to engage in data transfer and processing much more quickly than with traditional methods of connectivity. How Does eSATA Work? The basic idea behind eSATA is make it possible to connect multiple drives without having to employ cables or wired connections of some sort. Traditional methods of connecting the external hard drives relied upon the use of such devices as FireWire or USB cables. eSATA does away with all that and makes it possible to connected several external drives in a very short period of time, without all the work of figuring out which cable will do the job. ESATA is based on established standards and will work every time. What Are Some of the Advantages of eSATA? One of the immediate advantages of using eSATA is that the eSATA cables are usually longer and easier to distinguish from the jumble of wiring that is used to connect various devices. Anyone who operates even a home system knows how easy it is for wires and cables to become snared as they run across one another and make it virtually impossible to tell what runs where. eSATA cables are generally at least six feet long and tend to be somewhat different in appearance than USB cables and FireWire. One glance at the cable and you know what it is and where it goes. Another advantage is the ease of connecting and disconnecting the external drive. ESATA drives are designed with what are known as hot plugs. This means the cables can be connected and disconnected with ease, and without the need to power down the system in order to add or remove a drive. Along with the esthetics, eSATA also helps to provide excellent rates of data transfer that are sometimes better than can be achieved with a USB connection. There are currently versions of eSATA on the market that will provide data transfer speeds of between 150MBps to 300 MBps. That is a great deal of power when it comes to using an external drive, and is generally much better than can be achieved using a USB cable. THOUSANDS QUALITY but FREE PLR ARTICLES @ www.

    "title": "What is dBm?",
    "body": "2021/01/27 - dBm Sometimes identified as dBmW, dBm has to do with the degree of power measured in decibels as it relates to one millwatt. The calculation of dBm is helpful in several different types of applications, and can be used to calculate any size power ratio. In most cases, dBm is used to measure absolute power in a given setting. What Types of Systems Make Use of dBm? Three basic types of networks will make use of a dBm calculation on a regular basis. Radio, microwave, and fiber optic networks all employ the use of dBm. In each case, the measurement helps to ensure that the amount of wattage employed by the network remains within proscribed limits, but is sufficient to generate the energy required for operation. How Is dBm Calculated? It is important to note that dBm is referenced to the watt. This means that dBm represents an absolute unit, which is essential to the task of defining absolute power. Essentially, a zero dBm is the equivalent of one milliwatt. This means that in the event of the occurrence of 3 milliwatts, the dBm would come to 4. If the millwatts were less than one, such as a half millwatt, that would make the dBm roughly a -3, since the power is reduced by half. How Widespread is the use of dBm as a Calculation? The use of dBm is common in the United States, where unweighted measurement is employed in many different applications. This is especially true when it is necessary to ascertain the wattage involved in order to maintain transmissions within a certain bandwidth. Do Consumers Make Use of dBm? While consumers tend to reap the rewards of the use of dBm by various networks that deliver signaling, the average consumer has no real need for the use of dBm. The measurement tool is mainly used by professionals who are responsible for maintaining proper bandwidth in accordance with federal regulations and guidelines. Still, it must be noted that just about every consumer will benefit from the use of dBm in some way. Everything from telephone calls to bandwidth on home computers, radio to television broadcasts, and a number of other related transmissions are monitored and measured with the use of dBm. "

    "title": "What is an EPROM?",
    "body": "2021/01/27 - EPROM or Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory is rewritable memory chip that can hold its data without power. A programmed EPROM can keep its data for up to twenty years and can be read indefinite number of times. An Israeli engineer, Dov Frohman invented the EPROM chip in 1971. EPROM chips are embedded on an external programming device before being used on the circuit board. The EPROM chip requires a costly ceramic chip package with a small quartz window that is sheltered with opaque, sticky tape. For reprogramming, the chip is extracted from the circuit board, the tape is detached and it is placed below a concentrated ultraviolet (UV) light of wavelength 235nm light for approximately 20 minutes. Some microcontrollers, before the era of EEPROMs and flash memory, used EPROM to store their program. Such microcontrollers include some versions of the Intel 8048, and the “C” edition of the PIC microcontroller. Similar to EPROM chips, such microcontrollers came in windowed (expensive) versions that were handy for debugging and program development. Leaving the die of such a chip exposed to sunlight can change its behavior in unexpected ways. EPROMs come in several sizes with regard to both packaging and storage capacity. Parts of the same type of EPROM from different manufacturers are intercompatible as long as they’re only being read, there are subtle differences in the programming process. Most EPROMs can be identified by the programmer by forcing 12V on pin A9 and reading the two bytes of data. However, programmer software would allow manual setting of the chip to ensure proper programming. EPROMs are the forerunners of the modern EEPROMs and flash memory.

    "title": "What is a Runtime Error?",
    "body": "2021/01/27 - Runtime errors are glitches or problems that occur when a computer program is executed. Because a wide range of errors is usually grouped under the collective term of a runtime error, the operating system usually provides some information about the nature of the error that has occurred. The message provides the end user or the technician with some idea of what component has failed to launch properly, and provides a starting point for seeking resolution to the issue. A runtime error may occur due to some serious corruption within the program, or it could simply be a one time event that can be overcome by simply rebooting the program and starting over. However, when the runtime error continues to appear consistently, that is an indication that a permanent issue exists, and should be addressed as soon as possible. How Do I Report A Runtime Error? If you are at work and experience a runtime error with your workstation, your first option is to reboot the machine and see if you experience the same error a second time. It is not unusual for system support people to try this first as a way of clearing out whatever caused the runtime error, so it generally won’t hurt to try it yourself.  If this doesn’t work, then it is time to call for technical support. In order to assist the support team in dealing with the runtime error, it is a good idea for you to record basic information about the nature of the error. The first component you should make note of is the error message you receive along with the numerical designation of the runtime error. Be sure to copy the text of the message error exactly as it appears on your screen.  Do not attempt to summarize the content of substitute words in the text.  Runtime error messages are standardized and providing the support team with the correct information will make it much easier to fix the issue. Second, note exactly where you were in the system when the error took place. If you were putting together a letter in your word processing program, make note of the file you were using, it you had already saved it or were using a template. Identifying what you were doing will also help isolate the origin of the problem. Next, record exactly what you were doing when the runtime error occurred.  For example, if you had just attempted to save a letter, make note of that. If the error occurred when you started a new paragraph, or attempted to run the grammar or spell check feature, make sure to tell the support team that. If you know where to find this data, make sure to check the general state of the workstation when the error occurred, such as the memory, disk, and CPU usage. If you are not sure where to find this detail, simply pull back from the machine and wait for someone from the support team to provide you with further instructions. "

    "title": "What is a MAC Address?",
    "body": "2021/01/27 - MAC addresses are an example of an address that resides on the datalink layer of an OSI model. The addresses themselves are written into the hardware proper at the time that the model is manufactured. This has led to some people referring to a MAC address as a burned in address. Why is the MAC Address burned into the Data Link Layer? It is important to understand how a data link layer is set up. The DDL, also known as Layer 2 actually has two sub layers. One is referred to as the Media Access Control (or MAC) and the other is the Logical Link Control. It is within the MAC sublayer that the MAC address is burned during the production process. The reason for this action is to make sure there is a default address connected with the device and that no additional programming of an address is necessary in order for operation to take place. What Does the MAC Address Do? The main function of the MAC address in the sublayer is to aid in the way that a node on a network gains access to data and helps to provision the method that is used to transmit the data as well. Acting as an identifier, the MAC address essentially provides a place for data to collect and a launching point for data to be sent out and distributed. How is a MAC Address Set Up? The typical MAC address is forty-eight bits long. This number of bits makes the configuration of addresses virtually endless, although it is possible to calculate the exact number of MAC addresses that could be created with this number of bits. Suffice it to say the number of configurations is sufficient to ensure there will be no duplications for many years to come. In actual script, the MAC address will translate into a series of both letters and numbers. Is It Possible To Change A MAC Address? Yes. While it is true the originating MAC address is burned in at the time of production, there are software packages that can help to change an address with relative ease. The software will generally identify the next logical configuration and offer it for approval to the user before replacing the originating address. THOUSANDS QUALITY but FREE PLR ARTICLES @ www.

A Link Bid Directory is an internet directory that list links for a website according to the amount the particular link position auctioned-off for. The directory lists links alphabetically in order of highest bid. Bids can be purchased for a link at any time, by anybody, and all bids are counted toward a link’s total bid. The top 10 bidding links are displayed prominently on the home page, and if the administrator has chosen to enable the Link Leader, the highest bidding link will be displayed on every page. Most Link Bid Directories are Search engine friendly and optimised (SEO). Once listed, the links are displayed permanently. As time passes the webmaster of the site listed can increase their bid to keep their site link at the top of the listings - therefore at the top of every page. Are Link Bid Directories worth listing in? In my experience, yes they most certainly are. The exposure that your site would get is phenomenal; and your Page Rank would go up too. Because they are all SEO, your link will go up in rank with time. I’ve heard rumours that they are fun? They are immense fun to participate in. I understand you may be wondering what I am talking about here - how on earth are website directories fun to list in?!?! It all comes down to whether you will go to any length to outbid that pesky person that has bid $1 more than you… would you go and outbid them by $1 afterwards! I always out-bid my opponents because I find that the publicity gained from getting listed at the top of every page in the directory is excellent! Is it expensive? No, of course not. Most good Link Bid Directories will list your site link for only $1. This guarantees that your site will get listed for only $1! another benefit of only paying $1 is that as the link directory markets itself, your link gets marketed as well! Where can I find a Link Bid Directory? An easy way to find a directory is to just search on a major search engine “Link Bid Directory $1”. One that I have used before (see IconBuffet link!) is Zewert. com. That directory is SEO and is marketed well. "

    "body": "2021/01/27 - A DIMM, or dual in-line memory module, is a double component of the single in-line memory module. In actual structure, DIMM contains several random-access memory chips on a single circuit board. This small board is connected to the computer motherboard. A single SIMM usually has a 36 data bit path, counting the usual four parity bits to the computer motherboard. This path normally requires a 72 pin connector between the circuit board and the motherboard. When Would DIMM Be Used? When there is a need for a larger path, DIMM can be used in place of the SIMM. Essentially, what this does is increase the data bits from 36 to 72, providing a 64 bit transfer. When the computer is used in a business situation, this added power can be very helpful. Can DIMM Be Connected In The Same Method? Yes and no. Yes, in that DIMM will reside on a smaller circuit board that is connected to the computer motherboard. However, the 72 pin connection that works with SIMM will not be sufficient for DIMM. The more powerful device will require a 168 pin connection in order to function. Will DIMM Eventually Replace SIMM Completely? This is highly likely. As even home computers begin to be configured into home networks, and the home computer is used for more functions than ever before, it is likely that DIMM will become more attractive to both residential and business users. In time, technology will most likely render SIMM obsolete and rely on DIMM as the in-line memory module of choice. Is It Possible To Update a Computer to Use DIMM Instead of SIMM? Yes.  Usually, this will simply mean modifying the pin connection to the motherboard and preparing a circuit board that will include the DIMM module instead of the SIMM. In systems that already allow for the connection of two SIMM modules, it is possible to substitute a single DIMM without making any alterations at all. Just about any computer that is powerful enough to drive Windows can be upgraded to include DIMM. However, it is always a good idea to have the system checked by a professional before making this change. THOUSANDS QUALITY but FREE PLR ARTICLES @ www.

The RAM is accessible through the computer’s brain called the CPU which stands for Central Processing Unit. RAM has the capability of being retrieved only while a computer is on. When the computer is turned off the RAM is no longer accessible. ROM chips along with BIOS (computer boot firmware) allows the RAM information to be retrievable when the computer is rebooted. RAM size and Location on the Computer System Most computers come equipped with 256 million bytes of RAM already on the computer. Additional RAM can be placed within the system. However, there is usually a limitation placed upon just how much RAM can be added to a computer system. RAM is not random as its name would lead one to believe. The RAM is highly controlled and the storage can be directly ascertained. There is a decisive method that RAM utilizes to make its memory available to certain areas of the computer system. Forms for RAM RAM is what is known as discrete microchips which means that it is separate. An additional form of RAM is modules which attach into outlets in the motherboard of the computer. A network of electrical pathways to the processor allows the connection to spark for the RAM. Why is RAM Important RAM serves the very important function of retrieving information that must be accessed in a quick manner. This operation is very similar to the human brain’s function in retrieving necessary facts from short term memory. Open files and the utilization of applications on a computer systems requires the assistance of RAM. Users that play alot of video games with detailed graphics or keep alot of folders open while on their computer, will need the use of additional RAM. This will allow them to better access the information they need when the time comes. RAM is held onto a limited time, but it allows the information to come up quickly and without much fuss on the part of the computer user. "

    "body": "2021/01/27 - HDMI HDMI, or high definition multimedia interface, is a type of audio and video interface that is used for the transmission of uncompressed digital streams. Essentially, HDMI can be considered an alternative method to transmitting data streams, rather than making use of conventional methods such as coaxial cabling, VGA, or component video equipment. What Type of Sources May Be Employed Using HDMI? Quite a number of devices and sources on the market today will work with the use of HDMI. The Blu-Ray disc player, a relatively new innovation, was created with the use of HDMI specifically in mind.  Most personal computers that are sold today are ready for use with HDMI, as are the majority of video game consoles in the stores currently. A set-top box also is usually compatible with HDMI, as are such entertainment options as digital television. Essentially, any type of computer interface today will function with the use of HDMI. How Does HDMI Work? HDMI will work with a single cable connection to such devices as televisions or personal computers. In general, HDMI will function fine with any television or PC that is standard, enhanced, or high definition in the video component. However, it is important to note that HDMI does work independently of many of the DTV standards, although use of HDMI will not impact the quality of the digital transmission. Generally, these standards apply to some configurations of MPEG movie clips and files. Since these are compressed, HDMI will simply decompress the data and make it possible to view the clip. Are All HDMI Versions The Same For All Devices? No. There is a range of specifications that are employed by HDMI, and a given device will be manufactured to comply with one of those specifications. The most simplistic specification is identified as 1. 0.  With each succeeding version, the capabilities of the previous version remain intact, but are joined by other capabilities that will allow the version to function with a given device. Because technology is always advancing, HDMI continues to advance as well. However, older versions remain active, as they are often used with devices that require less functionality, and they also continue to be helpful in situations where older systems are still running and are in operation. Where Did HDMI Come From? HDMI was created and has been enhanced by the efforts of several prominent names in the computer and electronics industry. Consumers will recognize the names of Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Silicon Image as just part of the roster of corporations involved in the ongoing enhancement of HDMI. "

As the descriptive name implies, HDCP is all about protecting the integrity of various audio and video content as it travels over a multiplicity of different types of interfaces. Such data interfaces as GVIF, DVI, and HDMI will all support the functionality of HDCP. Is HDCP Free? No.  HDCP requires an authorized license. The license can be obtained through Digital Content Protection, which is a subsidiary of Intel Corporation. Generally, the license can be obtained by filing an application and paying an annual fee. Once the application is accepted and the user agrees to the terms found in the licensing agreement, the right to make use of HDCP is granted. What Are Some Of The Key Terms of Use For HDCP? One key term has to do with the transmission of data to unauthorized receivers. That is, an HDCP protected video source is not allowed to transmit protected content to any receiver that has not be verified to be HDCP compliant. There is also a restriction on the quality of the content, making sure that the DVD-audio content is equal to or less than CD-audio quality on any non-HDCP digital audio outputs. The licensed operator also covenants to not use their equipment to produce copies of content, and also to make sure that original content is created within the confines of current content protection requirements. What Type of Devices Make Use of HDCP? There are a number of different devices that make use of HDCP. DVD players are a common example, including systems that support high-definition DVD components. Blu-Ray discs are another example. Generally, it is possible for the manufacturer of the device to set what is known as an Image Constraint Token that will structure the type of output signal that can be read and translated. How Widespread Is The Use of HDCP? Since 2004, HDCP has been widely used in the United States. Elsewhere, HDCP has also gained a firm hold. The European Industry Association for Information Systems has deemed HDCP as a required component on all HD ready European devices. The latest Microsoft operating system, Windows Vista, makes use of HDCP as part of the function of graphics cards and monitors. THOUSANDS QUALITY but FREE PLR ARTICLES @ www.

The original design for Ethernet was created by Xerox, and was based on an earlier design that was known as Alohanet. After the initial creation and success of Ethernet, the product went through further enhancement under the auspices of Xerox, Intel, and DEC. How Did Ethernet Get Its Name? Robert Metcalfe, who was one of the developers working on the original design, came up with the name. The designation is based on the idea of light transmitting ether that was at one time thought to be found throughout the universe as a main component of the spread of light. Because cabling also functions as a medium that is somewhat passive, the correlation with ether seemed like a good fit. How Does Ethernet Work? Ethernet usually makes use of twisted pair wires or coaxial cable in the basic design of a wired local area network. However, the same general principle applies to wireless Ethernet as well. Various devices are connected to the cable or wires and achieve connectivity to Ethernet through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection. In general, Ethernet systems are referred to as 10BASE-T and are capable of producing speeds of up to 10 Mbps. What Are Some Types of Ethernet? Along with the standard 10BASE-T, there is also today what is known as Fast Ethernet.  Properly designated as 100BASE-T, this form of Ethernet is capable of producing transmission speeds that are up to one hundred megabits per second. Generally, Fast Ethernet is used as a backbone for the LAN system, with the 10BASE-T cards used for the workstations that are supported by the LAN. Gigabit Ethernet takes the process one step further. This form of Ethernet will provide up to one thousand megabits per second and is an excellent option for large networks that require a great deal of support to manage local and remote work stations. 10-Gigabit Ethernet provides the greatest power currently available. This type of Ethernet offers up to ten billion bits per second, making it the fastest version currently available. "

It is estimated that in the first three months of 2005 over 80% of computer users had a computer unknowingly infected with spyware. You may have unintentionally downloaded spyware on your computer when you visited a site and downloaded software you wanted, or, when you downloaded that cute cartoon e mail program from your friend. What spyware does is allow someone to observe your computer use and track your behavior on the computer. Some of these programs are keystroke loggers, adware and so-called system monitors. Generally those that maliciously install spyware software on your computer are being paid by a third party for the information they gain from tracking you and hundreds of thousands like you. It’s said that spyware is a billion dollar industry, one that isn’t going away anytime soon. A lawsuit was recently filed in New York against a Los Angeles company called Intermix Media. The lawsuit is based upon the State of New York’s General Business Law which prohibits false advertising and deceptive business practices and laws against trespass. A successful lawsuit against Intermix Media could spell doomsday to the spyware industry. Until then, you need to know what to do to protect your computer from spyware. Once on your computer spyware can be very hard to remove. At it’s best spyware will cause your computer to slow down. At its’ worst spyware can change settings on your computer and display advertising you don’t want. There are many anti-spyware programs available on the market today. You should perform an on demand scan of your computer on a regular basis. It is suggested that you re-boot your computer after the initial scan and then re-scan to make sure that there are no “ticklers” left behind on your computer. These ticklers are designed to reinstall spyware. Don’t forget to run your regular anti virus software on a regular basis. Beware of free downloads of any type of files, music, video, free wall paper, etc. These can have hidden spyware. "

While many people know of the internet and the World Wide Web as communication methods, the electronic-data-interchange is much similar. It allows the transfer of data from one place to the next with very minimal need for people to get involved. Today, the Electronic-Data-Interchange is regulated. It offers specific interchange methods that transpire overseas and nationally as standard bodies when it comes to moving information and business transactions from one place to the next. For example, this is the most common form of communication in the process of purchasing goods and services. Communication for the location to the financial institution to deliver a message of the amount of funds required, in this case, is what data will be transferred. In most cases, the information that is transmitted in an electronic data interchange is done so that companies can communicate. They can provide information to allow business transactions or the passage of very important information. For example, in the healthcare industry they can be used to help communicate through the network about a patient allowing for a faster method of receiving information. This technology is still being developed in many areas, though. In fact, more and more so, people are turning to Electronic-Data-Interchange as their means of communication especially with more people turning to the Internet. The Electronic-Data-Interchange allows for networks of all sorts to communicate and this is helping ecommerce as a great way for companies to buy, sell or trade information and services. In fact, ANSI has just approved a set of Electronic-Data-Interchange standards. They are known as the X12 standards.

Like an intranet, it is web browser based, making information available on any computer without any special equipment. However, an extranet does require extensive security and may need special software to provide user authentication and to encrypt data. Extranets are used to extend your business applications to suppliers, clients, vendors, customers or other businesses. They make sharing data simpler and more cost effective. Extranets have even allowed companies to save money from an unexpected source – allowing employees to telecommute. As a result, a company can save on the cost of maintaining on-premises offices and equipment for these employees. Some uses of extranets include: Supporting day-to-day collaboration by service companies who need to share and organize documents with their clients  Exchanging billing invoices and payments through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) Sharing online catalogs with suppliers, vendors and customers to eliminate printing costs Entering into joint ventures with other businesses Collaborating with other companies to develop training materials Providing online services to customersOne of the best known extranets in the word is the UPS package tracking system. Most people don’t realize that they are using an extranet to track their packages, but they are. The customer, whether business or individual, logs in to the UPS network over the internet to see where their package is and when it will be delivered. Like intranets, large companies have been using extranets for years. The need for special software, firewalls, and trained personnel put them beyond the means of smaller businesses. However, like intranets, extranets can be purchased from application service providers who will host and maintain the extranet software and “rent” access at a cost substantially lower than implementing and maintaining an internal system.

When a computer is turned on, it looks for boot informati… antivirus software, norton antivirus, pccillin, anti virus, norton, virus, trojan horse For a virus or similar program to have any great impact it needs to be able to spread from one machine to another. They are specifically designed to get access to parts of your computer system that allow for communication with other machines. Below is a discussion of some of the most common methods. Boot Infectors Every disk (hard disk, floppy, CD, DVD) contains a boot sector whether it is a bootable disk or not. When a computer is turned on, it looks for boot information. If the computer finds a disk with boot information, it reads that information and uses it to properly start the computer. If for some reason that boot information is infected with a virus, the virus is activated and possibly transferred to the computer’s hard drive (if the infection was on a CD for example). Once the boot code on the hard drive is infected the virus will be loaded into your computer’s memory every time you start your computer. From memory the boot virus can travel to any and every disk that is put into your computer. This is how the infection spreads. Most boot viruses could be on a system for a long time without causing problems, simply existing there to spread themselves. Often such viruses are designed to activate their bad behaviour on a specific date (Halloween for example). There are some nasty boot viruses that will destroy the boot information or force a complete format of the hard drive immediately after they get into a computer. Program Infectors When an infected application is run the virus activates and is loaded into memory. While the virus is in memory any new program file that you run can become infected. This means that there will be increasingly more applications on your system that are infected. Multiple infections are very common and will certainly cause system problems. Program files may function without any problems for some time but eventually they will have problems or multiple infections brings the entire computer system down. The data the program produces may be a first sign of infection such as saving files without proper names, or with incorrect/incomplete data being saved. Viruses of this type are often designed to seek out programs that are used to share information between users/computers such as email applications, screen savers, office document Macros, and self-extracting compressed files. Through e-mail attachments Many of the most dangerous viruses are primarily spread through e-mail attachments - files that can be sent along with an e-mail message. In such cases, the user of an infected computer unknowingly attaches an infected file to an email message, and then sends the email to a friend or colleague. When the email is received, the virus is launched when the file attachment is opened, thus infecting a new computer. Email messages with animations, automated greeting cards, jokes, photographs, spreadsheet and document files, all have been documented to contain virus files. More and more frequently these days mass mailing email worms/viruses are being released. These attacks AUTOMATICALLY scan your computer’s files for any email address it can find and then uses your email application to AUTOMATICALLY send infected messages to any email address found in any file on your computer (not just email message files). It is important to be aware of the emails that you open to make sure that they do not contain harmful viruses. Even emails from family and friends could have a virus, if that person’s computer is infected. This is where an anti-virus software would be really helpful in detecting if there is a virus in any incoming messages. "

    "body": "2021/01/27 - Self-learning solutions are particularly compelling when it comes to Boolean logic. We emphasize that ARGOL is derived from the principles of artificial intelligence. Existing empathic and certifiable heuristics use the robust unification of rasterization and digital-to-analog converters to store the synthesis of voice-over-IP. Existing encrypted and event-driven applications use trainable configurations to prevent the evaluation of e-commerce. Thusly, our solution is NP-complete. A major source of our inspiration is early work by S. Davis on public-private key pairs. The original approach to this grand challenge by Jones et al. was considered compelling; contrarily, such a hypothesis did not completely overcome this issue. Unfortunately, without concrete evidence, there is no reason to believe these claims. Jones developed a similar approach, however we demonstrated that our solution runs in (logn) time. Thusly, the class of systems enabled by ARGOL is fundamentally different from related approaches. Reality aside, we would like to emulate a methodology for how our framework might behave in theory. We believe that self-learning symmetries can enable collaborative archetypes without needing to manage linear-time archetypes. Furthermore, consider the early architecture by T. Davis et al. ; our methodology is similar, but will actually fulfill this purpose. Obviously, the architecture that ARGOL uses is solidly grounded in reality. The design for ARGOL consists of four independent components: evolutionary programming, RAID, adaptive symmetries, and extensible modalities. This seems to hold in most cases. Next, we assume that I/O automata can store XML without needing to provide replicated technology. This is a natural property of ARGOL. we consider an application consisting of n journaling file systems. As a result, the architecture that our framework uses is solidly grounded in reality. In conclusion, our experiences with ARGOL and stable archetypes disconfirm that Web services and erasure coding can agree to answer this grand challenge. One potentially limited shortcoming of ARGOL is that it can study fiber-optic cables; we plan to address this in future work. We also constructed a perfect tool for developing superpages. "

By outsourcing, you can: Reduce overheads, free up resourcesAvoid capital expenditureImprove efficiencyOffload non-core functionsGet access to specialized skillsSave on manpower and training costsReduce operating costsImprove speed and serviceEstablish long-term, strategic relationships with world-class service providers to gain a competitive edgeEnhance tactical and strategic advantagesFocus on strategic thinking, process reengineering and managing trading partner relationshipsSpread your risksProvide the best quality services, products and peopleBe reliable and innovativeProvide value-added servicesIncrease customer satisfactionAvoid the cost of chasing technologyLeverage the provider’s extensive investments in technology, methodologies and peopleBenefit from the provider’s expertise in solving problems for a variety of clients with similar requirements.

The Outsourcing Institute finds, “Outsourcing is rapidly becoming an accepted management tool for redefining and re energizing the corporation. It challenges today’s executives to rethink the traditional, vertically integrated firm in favor of a more flexible organization structured around core competencies and long-term, outside relationships. ” Highlights: Global giants such as IBM, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, AT&amp;T, Fujitsu, Motorola, Digital, Hewlett-Packard Philips, General Electric, IBM, Reebok, Fujitsu, British Aerospace, General Motors and Sears are keeping ahead of their rivals thanks to the competitive advantage conferred on them by some of the best software companies in India . You too can benefit immensely from a successful outsourcing strategy. Several convergent forces like an exponential increase of technology in the workplace, electronic commerce, enterprise systems and a sharp increase in internet related new entities are resulting in an increased demand for software professionals. The need is further compounded by the lack of trained programmers in the developed countries, especially United States , Western Europe and Japan . Demand exceeds supply, which has led to increased labor costs, longer product development and even longer time to market.

    "body": "2021/01/23 - Viral mengenai surat edaran Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Surabaya soal kawasan bebas dari kucing liar. Kucing-kucing ini dinilai mengganggu tamu kampus. Dalam sebuah penelitian yang dilakukan oleh Pete Marra selaku kepala Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, kucing juga dianggap bisa merusak ekosistem karena membuat spesies burung menjadi punah Padahal kucing ialah hewan yang menyenangkan dan memiliki wajah lucu. Tak jarang kucing juga memiliki sifat yang manja. Sejak zaman Rasulullah SAW, kucing disebut-sebut sebagai hewan kesayangan Nabi Muhammad Ada sebuah hadist dari Abu Qotadah, Nabi SAW bersabda: “Kucing itu tidaklah najis. Sesungguhnya kucing ialah hewan yang sering kita jumpai dan berada di sekeliling kita. ” (HR. At Tirmidzi, Abu Daud, An Nasa’i, Ibnu Majah, Ad Darimi, Ahmad, Malik. ) Bahkan Rasulullah saking senang dan sayang dengan kucing. Beliau pernah membiarkan seekor kucing menyelesaikan menikmati minumnya di bejana yang berisi air padahal beliau hendak berwudhu. Dikutip dalam buku berjudul “Hak-hak yang Wajib Anda Ketahui dalam Islam” oleh Syaikh Muhammad Hassan, diceritakan ada seorang wanita dimasukkan ke neraka gara gara menyekap kucing dan tidak memberinya makan. Wanita ini juga tidak membiarkan kucing itu makan serangga-serangga tanah. Dari Ibnu Umar RA Nabi Muhammad SAW bersabda, “Seorang wanita dimasukkan ke dalam neraka karena seekor kucing yang dia ikat dan tidak dibiarkan makan bahkan tidak diperkenankan makan binatang-binatang kecil yang ada di lantai. ” (HR Bukhari, Kitab Ahadits Al-Anbiya, 3467; Muslim, Kitab As-Salam, 2245) Enter text in Markdown.

    "title": "Home Schooling Requirements: Differences In States.",
    "body": "2021/01/21 - Homeschooling has increased more in the past few years than it has for the past decades. Initially, homeschooling or any type of private education wasnt allowed in the United States, but when a public court ruled for the Society of Sisters for the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary and allowed them to set up a private school in 1925, public schools werent the only institutions providing education to children. This sparked the homeschooling idea and not long after, parents have decided to educate their children in their own homes. Homeschooling is legal in all 50 states; however, each state has different requirements and guidelines reagrding the homeschooling program. Some states simply require parents who opt for homeschooling, to simply file an intent notice to the local school superintendent or any school official, and some require lesson plans to be made and approved by the school board before the program starts. All of these requirements aim to fully educate children whether they are educated at home or in public schools. In California, homeschoolers have three choices, thay can use a credited tutor, enroll in a qualified private school or be part of an independent public homeschooling program. Parents may form private schools for their own children; however, all those who wish to form private schools need to file an annual report with the Department of Education. Certain courses, similar to that of public schools, that can fit into a few pages, (contrary to the hundreds of pages required of public schoosl) need to be present, as well as attendance records. But teachers need not have credentials, they must simply be capable of teaching. Differences in state requirements can also be observed in testing and assessment. Some states require homeschoolers to take standardized tests or have evaluations done by qualified teachers. Other states however, do not require such evaluation methods. In California again, students are encouraged to take the standardized tests that Public Schools are implementing at the end of every term. Graduating procedures also differ with states, some require that home schools be operated as private schools, have graduation procedures that doent differ from private school gradaution. However, some have no graduation requirements at all; basically, the schools determine who graduates or not, this applies to homeschoolers in the state as well. In other states, homeschoolers receive no recognition, but are still granted access to colleges and universities. Requirements and laws differ from state to state, and there is no absolute list of requirements for the whole United States. The best a parent who intends to homeschool her child is to find web sites or go to local school officials for information. "

    "body": "2021/01/21 - Blogger is one of the many options available to bloggers who are looking for free blog software. This website located at the following web address: http://www. blogger. com offers registered users the opportunity to publish their own blog free of charge. The website also has templates the blogger can use to create his blog and even enables bloggers to easily place Google advertisements on their blog and coordinates an AdSense account for the users so they can potentially earn a profit from their blog. This article will discuss the history of Blogger as well as the terms of service. The History of Blogger Blogger began in 1999 with a small group of friends in the San Francisco area who ran a company called Pyra Labs. These friends did not set out to create a network of bloggers but nevertheless Blogger emerged from their efforts. The three friends who developed bloggers were programmers who toiled away for others in an effort to fund their own endeavors. As previously mentioned a blog network was not their original goal but the friends were intrigued by the idea as it emerged and found others were interested too as their concept quickly took off and new members were joining everyday. Like most Internet entrepreneurs of this time period, they experienced setbacks but continued to persevere. In 2002 Blogger was doing well but got an unexpected surprise when Google expressed interest in purchasing Pyra Labs. Google was interested in the upswing in the blogging community and the members of Pyra Lab sold their company enabling Google to take over the operation. Since taking over Google introduced the concept of AdSense advertising campaigns on blogs which has been generating profits for Google and bloggers alike. Blogger not only offers members templates to create a blog and voice their opinions on the Internet but also simplifies the process of placing AdSense advertisements on the blog. Blogger Terms of Service The Terms of Service of Blogger are susceptible to change but there are a few basic terms which users can expect to exist. The Terms of Service for Blogger provides explanations of items such as the services offered, description of proper use of the services, privacy policies, an explanation of intellectual property rights, cause for termination and information regarding the legal jurisdiction of the website. Members of Blogger are advised to carefully review these policies before becoming a member and to be sure they understand and agree to all of these terms. If the potential member is unsure about the meaning of one or more of the terms, he should contact Blogger to seek clarification on the Terms of Service. Members of Blogger should also be aware that the Terms of Service may change and should review these terms periodically to ensure there have been no changes made which will adversely impact the member. Members of Blogger should pay particular attention to the section of the Terms of Service which specify causes for termination of a members account. This information is important because it will help to prevent the member from inadvertently performing an action which may result in his account being terminated or suspended. Blogger is not required to inform the member of the infractions before suspending the account so a member will likely lose his account before he is even aware he has violated the Terms of Service agreement.

    "body": "2021/01/21 - Blogging for Profit Blogging is becoming an increasingly popular way for entrepreneurs to earn a living online while doing something they really enjoy. In many cases bloggers can profit with very little effort. There may be quite a bit of work involved in the beginning with designing a method of gaining revenue and promoting the website but once this is established simply maintaining the blog with regular postings may be enough to keep the revenue rolling in. Two of the most popular methods for generating a profit from blogging include advertising methods. This includes advertising with AdSense and securing independent advertisers. This article will discuss these two methods of advertising on a blog. Using AdSense to Generate Revenue Using AdSense is one of the most popular ways for bloggers to generate revenue from their blog. This method is so popular because it is also very simple. AdSense is a program offered by Google where bloggers agree to have advertisements on their website and are compensated when users click on these advertisements. Bloggers simply have to create a blog and submit the website address of the blog as well as some other information to apply for participation in AdSense. Once a blog is approved the owner is given code they can simply copy and paste to have advertisements displayed on their blog. Google then serves appropriate advertisements each time the blog is accessed. Whenever possible, the advertisements served on the blog are closely related to the content of the blog because Google crawls the website ahead of time to determine which advertisements are relevant to the content. Blog owners do have some ability to place restrictions on the types of advertisements which may appear on the blog. For example the blog owner can specify adult advertisements are not to appear on the blog and Google will filter these out. How Advertisements on a Blog Generate Revenue Many bloggers use advertisements on their blogs to generate a profit. This method of advertising is more difficult than using AdSense but it can be significantly more financially beneficial to the blogger. This method of advertising is similar to the type of targeted advertising often seen in magazines. For example magazines for parents often feature advertisements which will appeal to parents such as advertisements for toys, childrens clothing or foods popular with children. Likewise a magazine for runners may feature advertisements for shoes, athletic clothing, races or training equipment. In these cases the advertisers pay for advertising space in the magazine in the hopes that the magazines audience will be enticed to purchase products or services after seeing these advertisements. Blog owners can use this type of advertising but it can be hard to find willing advertisers. However, there are some factors which may make an advertiser more willing to have an advertisement appear on a blog. One of the most important factors for advertisers is the amount of traffic the blog receives. This is important because advertisers who are paying for ad space are more likely to invest in a blog with high traffic than one with very little traffic. Another important factor for advertisers is the focus of the blog. Advertisers are more likely to purchase advertising space from a blog with a specific focus of interest to the advertisers target audience. Like the examples listed previously of magazines for parents and runners, advertisers want to advertise on a blog which is already reaching the same target audience. Bloggers who utilize advertising on their website may be compensated in a number of different ways. Some advertisers may pay a set fee for the advertisement to run on the website for either a set amount of time or for a set number of page views. This means the advertiser may purchase space for a set number of days, weeks or months or may purchase space for a set number of times the advertisement is served to website visitors. Alternately the advertiser may choose to compensate the blogger according to the number of times specific actions occur. This may include users clicking through the advertisement or users making a purchase after clicking through the advertisement. The type of compensation offered will have to be worked out between the blogger and advertiser beforehand to determine a fair method of payment. Blogging with Wordpress Wordpress is one of the many options available to bloggers who are looking for free software online which makes it incredibly easy to publish their own blog. This software is easy to use, provides a variety of templates and offer excellent support to bloggers. There are many options available to bloggers and other blogging programs may be better known and offer slightly different features but many bloggers are quite pleased with Wordpress. This article will offer some useful information for bloggers who are considering starting a blog with Wordpress such as reasons to choose Wordpress, tips on starting a blog and information about the support offered by Wordpress. Based on this information as well as their own research bloggers can decide whether Wordpress is right for them or whether they should seek out a different blog network. Reasons to Choose Wordpress There are many great reasons to choose Wordpress to start a blog. Some of these reasons include a great variety of templates, the ability to categorize and tag posts easily, features such as spell check, previews and autosave, the ability to post text, audio files and video files, a variety of privacy options and the ability to track statistical data related to the blog in addition to other great features. Some of these features may be more important to some bloggers than others so deciding whether or not Wordpress is right for you will largely be a matter of personal preference. For example bloggers with little or no programming experience may enjoy the myriad of templates available on Wordpress while bloggers who are concerned about privacy issues may be more interested in the privacy options available through Wordpress. Carefully investigating these features will help bloggers determine if they should start a blog with Wordpress. Starting a Blog with Wordpress Bloggers who opt to start a blog with Wordpress will certainly not be disappointed by the amount of time it takes to start a blog. A blogger can literally start a blog with Wordpress within minutes. This is tremendously important to bloggers who are eager to get started and do not want to deal with a long process to start a blog. The only requirements for starting a blog are a valid email address and a username. The blogger enters this information into the signup page and receives a password almost instantly. Next the blogger simply has to check his email, follow the activation link provided and use the password provided and the process is complete. The blogger can start blogging immediately. Support Offered by Wordpress For many first time bloggers the type of support offered is very important. This is because first time bloggers may have quite a few questions about the process of starting a basic blog and once they establish a basic blog they may have additional questions about using advanced features and customizing the blog. Wordpress offers a great deal of support for bloggers of all skill levels. The support offered by Wordpress includes the ability to contact the support staff as well as the ability to receive support from other members through online forums. Although the support staff is incredibly responsive some bloggers enjoy the ability to communicate with other bloggers in forums. This is because the forums are active 24 hours a day and bloggers can find support from peers at any time. Careers in Blogging Many freelance writers are beginning to find blogging is one of the newest career opportunities available to them. Blogging is essentially a series of postings on a particular subject which are listed in reverse chronological order. These blogs may be about a variety of different subjects and may be personal, political, informative, humorous or any other category desired by the blogger. However, the key to a successful blog is a blog which pertains to a subject which appeals to a wide audience. Additionally the blog should be updated regularly and should provide useful content to the readers of the blog. This article will provide some information on finding career opportunities in blogging, will discuss the benefits of this type of career and will provide information on how writers can manage a blog successfully. Finding Blogging Career Opportunities Although blogging career opportunities are becoming increasingly popular, many writers are not aware of how to find these wonderful opportunities. These career opportunities may be offered as ghost writing positions or as positions offering a byline to the writer and finding these blogging opportunities is often very similar to finding any other career opportunities for writers. Companies seeking a blogger may post the job opening in the same manner in which they would post other openings with the company such as accounting positions or administrative positions. Therefore, writers interested in a position as a blogger should utilize the same job search websites they rely on to find other career opportunities. Bloggers may also wish to visit career websites and message boards which focus exclusively on careers in blogging. The ProBlogger. net website is just one example of a website dedicated exclusively to putting bloggers in connection with those who are interested in hiring a writer for a particular blog. Interested bloggers should also consider joining message boards for those who blog for a living. This can be beneficial because here bloggers are likely to share information regarding the companies for which they work as well as any information they have about companies who are currently looking to hire bloggers. The Benefits of a Career in Blogging There are many benefits to pursuing a career in blogging. Perhaps one of the most alluring benefits to a career in blogging is the work can typically be done as a telecommute position. This is because as long as the blogger has access to the software necessary to write and upload a blog, there is no need for the blogger to perform the work from a specific location. This means the blogger can reside virtually anywhere in the world and can likely perform the necessary work from his own home. However, not all blogging positions are telecommute positions. Some companies may require bloggers to perform the work onsite as a matter of personal preference. Another benefit to a career in blogging is the ability to accomplish work at a pace which his convenient to the blogger. The blogger may be required to upload a new post to the blog according to a regular schedule but the actually writing of the posts can be accomplished when it is convenient for the blogger. Many blogging software packages enable the blogger to set a specific time for a specific post to be uploaded. This allows the blogger to write several posts at a time and have them publish according to a pre-determined schedule. Finding Time to Blog One of the problems which many bloggers face is finding the time to blog. This is especially difficult if the blogger maintains several blogs or if the blogger maintains a current events blog in which posts must be timely in order to be relevant and of interest to the readers. Writing blog posts in batches and scheduling them to publish as needed is one way to deal with managing several blogs. However, writers of blogs related to current events must take special care to budget their time wisely to ensure they are publishing topical blog posts. One way this can be accomplished is by setting aside time daily to reading current events to derive inspiration and then scheduling time after that to write and publish the blog. For example a blogger with a current events blog might choose to review the previous days news the first thing in the morning to ensure they are reviewing all of the relevant news from the previous day before writing the blog post. Dealing with Comments on Your Blog Most blogs allow visitors to the blog to post comments on any of the blog posts. These comments may pertain to the blog posting or may be completely unrelated. The comments may also be positive or negative in nature. Regardless of the type of comment left by a visitor the blogger may choose to deal with these comments in a number of different ways. The blogger may answer these comments, block individual visitors from leaving comments in the future or use administrative features to delete comments or set the blog to require approval of the comments before they are posted on the blog. This article will discuss each of these options for dealing with comments on a blog in greater detail. Answering Comments on Your Blog Bloggers who receive comments on their blog may wish to answer these comments. Most blogging programs allow the blogger to post comments on his own blog which enables the blogger to answer comments directly. With this feature a blogger can deal with a number of different situations including negative comments, positive comments and questions. Bloggers who receive negative comments on their blog may opt to answer these comments directly with a rebuttal to the negative comments. This allows the blogger to recognize the criticism and defend his original post. Bloggers who receive positive comments may also wish to answer these comments to thank the visitors for the praise. Still other bloggers may receive comments which ask a question about the blog post or the blogger himself. Bloggers may opt to answer these questions to develop a better relationship with the blog visitors. Blocking Comments from Individual Visitors Another option for dealing with blog comments which are negative in nature is to block comments from individual blog visitors. In most cases bloggers will have the ability to blog a particular user from leaving comments on the blog. The blogger may wish to use this option in situations where the comments from the blog visitor are extremely mean spirited. The blogger may also wish to ban individual blog visitors from making comments if he has previously attempted to explain his point to the visitor but the visitor continues to post negative comments. A blogger may also wish to ban an individual blog visitor from making comments if he believes the comments are being left as spam. Using Administrative Features Still another option for dealing with comments on a blog includes using administrative features to delete comments or modify the settings to not allow comments to be displayed until the blogger approves them. Blog owners typically have the ability to delete a comment left by a blog visitor. Deleting these comments is usually a quite simple process. However, it is not a completely effective method because other blog visitors may have the opportunity to read these comments before they are deleted. Therefore, deleting the comment may prevent some visitors from reading the comment but will not ensure the comment is not seen by any blog visitors. However, there is a way for bloggers to make sure visitors do not read negative comments. Most types of blogging software have options which require the blogger to approve all comments before they become available to the public. This gives the blogger the ability to delete a comment before it is read by any of the blog visitors. The blogger can simply delete any comments they do not wish others to read before the comments are published. Design Elements of a Blog A blog may be essentially an online journal displayed in reverse chronological order but it is also a website which requires the same attention to detail any other website requires. It also requires the same design elements as a regular website which does not also function as a blog. Bloggers have decisions to make regarding design elements of the blog such as colors and layout, fonts and the inclusion of advertisements. Although many blog software programs provide a variety of templates which make designing a blog rather simple, blogs can also be highly customized by bloggers who possess some programming skills. This article will discuss some of the basic design considerations bloggers encounter. Colors and Layouts of a Blog The colors and layout of a blog is one of the most obvious design considerations bloggers must consider when starting or re-designing their blog. Bloggers may use a solid color background, blocks of different colors in the background or pictures or textures in the background. These background elements can be any color imaginable. However, bloggers who are considering the colors to use in their blog should consider using colors which will be aesthetically appealing to most blog visitors. This is important because the use of garish colors which are harsh on the eye can result in diminished blog traffic. The layout of the blog should also carefully be considered by the blogger. The blog should be arranged in a fashion which is appealing to blog visitors, suits the subject of the blog and is presented in a logical manner which is easy for visitors to follow. Again, this is important because failure to use a layout which meets these criteria may result in blog visitors choosing not to visit the blog anymore because the layout is confusing or unappealing. Fonts Used in a Blog Bloggers have a number of options available to them when selecting fonts to use in their blog. These options include the font chosen, the text size and the color of the text. Bloggers should consider choosing a font which works well with the overall design of the layout of the blog and suits the subject matter of the blog but also is a font which common. This is important because blog visitors may have trouble viewing the font if the blogger selects a unique font which is not common. The text size and colors of the text should also be carefully considered. These elements are primarily important for readability. Text size should be set so members of the target audience can easily read the text. For example a blogger with senior citizens as the target audience may opt to use a text size slightly larger than usual. The colors used for the text should also be selected to enhance readability. One way to do this is to select colors which are appealing to the eye but also contrast with the background color. Inclusion of Advertisements in a Blog Bloggers must also consider the inclusion of advertisements when they are designing their blogs. This includes determining whether or not to include blogs. Once this decision is made, bloggers who opt to include advertisements must carefully consider how and where they wish to display these advertisements. Advertisements can be displayed in various locations throughout the blog and can be designed to be discrete or obvious depending on the preferences of the blogger. Advertisements can also be a variety of sizes and shapes and are highly customizable in a number of different ways. Finding Blogs to Read There is a wide variety of blogs currently available. Internet users are fortunate to have a large number of blogs to choose from when seeking a blog to read regularly. There are also often many blogs available which cover a particular subject. Blogs can be about any subject imaginable. Some blogs are created to entertain while others are created to inform. Some blogs are created to generate a profit while other blogs are created to help others. With so many blogs currently available online it can be difficult to determine which blogs are worth reading and which are not. It can also make it difficult to limit the number of blogs the Internet user reads. This article will provide information on finding and selecting blogs to read including using search engines to find blogs, finding blogs through participation in message boards and seeking recommendations for blogs from friends or family members. Using Search Engines to Find Blogs Search engines are one of the most reliable resources Internet users often rely on to find useful websites. However, it is important to note search engines can also be extremely helpful for Internet users who are interested in finding blogs to read. An Internet user who is looking for a blog on a particular subject can start the process of finding these blogs by entering relevant keywords or phrases into a popular search engine and carefully reviewing the results provided for this search. However, this type of search will not necessarily provide the Internet users with blogs. In fact the search results may not include a blog on any of the first few pages in the search results despite returning pages upon pages of links to useful websites. One simple way the Internet user can use search engines to find blogs relating to a particular subject is to include the word blog with the keywords or phrases entered into the search engine. This will help to filter the search results and may push blogs towards the front of search results. However, Internet users are better off searching for collections of blogs and then searching within these collections for ones of interest. Finding Blogs on Message Boards Many Internet users rely on message boards to find interesting and informative blogs. This is because many message board participants who have a blog often find ways to make others aware of this blog. This may either be through the process of incorporating a link to the blog in the message board users signature or, when appropriate, supplying the link to the blog directly in the message body of a post on the message board. Although many bloggers may take advantage of the opportunity to promote their own blog through message boards, those who are interested in finding new blogs will likely not have time to review all of these blogs. Therefore, it is wise for these Internet users to be somewhat discriminating about the blogs they choose to visit. One way to do this is to only visit blogs of regular forum posters who offer valuable information to the conversations on the message board. The Internet user may also wish to avoid blogs which appear to be posted as spam. This is important because these blogs are not only likely poor quality but also visiting these blogs only encourages the blog owner to continue to spam message boards with his link. Seeking Recommendations for Blogs Finally, Internet users who are seeking blogs to read on a regular basis can consider seeking recommendations from friends or family members who share a particular interest. Friends or family members who are interested in the same subject as you may already regularly read blogs relevant to this interest. Asking them for recommendations is worthwhile because they have no reason to do anything but recommend blogs they really enjoy and assume you will be interested in as well. Also, this method of finding blogs is ideal because your friends and family members likely know your tastes and expectations well and will likely steer you in the right direction. Finding Your Blogging Niche Finding your blogging niche should be one of the aspects of blogging which the blogger carefully considers before starting a blog. This is especially important if the blogging is being done for the purpose of financial compensation. Ideally a blog owner should select a blog subject about which they are passionate and knowledgeable. However, bloggers should also carefully consider the direct competition as well as the purpose of the blog before starting their blog. This article will discuss these considerations in greater detail in an attempt to assists bloggers in choosing a subject for a new blog. This information is applicable to both bloggers who are completely new to blogging as well as experienced bloggers who are considering starting a new blog. Isolating Your Interests One of the first considerations for a new blogger is his personal interests. This is important because a blogger who is passionate and knowledgeable about a particular subject will not only have an easy time coming up with ideas for new blog posts but will also likely be highly successful. This success will likely be attributable to the fact that blog visitors can sense his passion for the subject matter and greatly appreciate the knowledgeable posts which are informative and accurate. The interests of the blogger may run the gamut from subjects which are widely popular to subjects which are of interest to only a small subset of the population. However, there will likely be interested readers regardless of the subject of the blog. Therefore bloggers are not discouraged from opting to blog about even the most obscure subjects. However, bloggers who are seeking financial gain through high blog traffic should consider selecting a topic which appeals to a larger audience. Evaluating the Competition Once a blogger has selected one or more subjects he is considering for a blog, it is time to begin evaluating the competition. This includes viewing other blogs covering the same subject matter. This will not only give the blogger a good indication of whether or not the market is already saturated with blogs on this subject and the quality of the existing blogs on this subject. Based on this information the blogger can make an informed decision about whether or not he feels capable of competing for blog traffic with the existing blogs. Considering the Purpose of the Blog Another important consideration for bloggers is the purpose of the blogs. Blogs can be created for a variety of reasons including financial compensation, personal use or to promote a cause. Bloggers who are starting a blog for personal use may only wish to consider their own interests when starting a blog because they are not likely seeking high blog traffic. However, bloggers who are creating a blog for purposes of generating a profit or promoting a cause do have to consider factors such as the ability to generate blog traffic. In these cases the blogger should choose a subject which appeals to a large audience. Additionally, the Internet should not already be saturated with blogs on this subject because it will likely be difficult for the new blog to garner a share of blog traffic. Finally, blog owners should consider the quality of the blog they are capable of creating on a particular subject. The blogger should choose a subject where he is confident he can not only make regular posts but also ensure these posts are original, informative and interesting. Improving the Search Engine Rankings of Your Blog Bloggers who are interested in reaching a large audience with their blog should consider paying special attention to search engine optimization of their blog. Reaching a large audience may be a priority for a number of different reasons. One of the obvious reasons to attempt to generate increased traffic to a blog is to generate a profit. Bloggers who rely on high blog traffic for their revenue are obviously interested in increasing traffic. However, bloggers who create their blog to promote a cause may also be interested in increasing traffic simply to allow their message to reach a larger audience. Regardless of the reason to want to increase traffic, one of the best ways to do this is by optimizing the blog for search engines. This article will discuss the importance of search engine rankings and offer tips for optimizing a blog. Why Search Engine Rankings are Important The importance of high search engine rankings is they can contribute to increased Internet traffic to the blog. This is because Internet users who use search engines to find information on a particular topic are much more likely to visit websites which appear on the first page of the search results than they are to visit websites which appear on subsequent pages of the search results. The websites appearing on the first page of the results are likely to get the most traffic. However, Internet users are not likely to search through more than a page or two of the search results when looking for more information on a particular subject. High search engine rankings essentially act as free advertisement for a blog or website. This is because many website users rely on popular search engines to assist them in finding useful information on the Internet. The search engines apply complex algorithms to evaluate websites and rank them accordingly for specific search terms. As a result Internet users put a great deal of value on the search results produced and trust these results to lead them to the best available websites relevant to the keywords they specified in the search. Tips for Optimizing a Blog for Search Engines One of the most common ways to optimize a blog or website for search engines is through the use of relevant keywords. Specifically the practice of applying specific keyword densities to the content of the blog is a common search engine optimization tactic employed. Blog owners and others who attempt to optimize their websites do not always agree on the optimal density for keywords but many believe a percentage of approximately 2%-3% is appropriate. Another method for optimizing a search engine optimization is to place relevant keywords into the code of the website. This includes the title tags and META tags. This is important because search engines often consider the prominence of keywords when evaluating a website. This refers to the location in which the keywords first appear. Placing keywords early in the content of the website is helpful but it is important to note the search engines view the code first so keywords appearing before the body of the blog will be crawled first by the search engines. Blog owners can also help to increase their search engine rankings by generating back links to their blog. This can be accomplished in a number of different ways. One way to do this is to find other websites willing to place a link to the blog on their website. This is beneficial because many search engines factor the number of links to a website into their ranking algorithm because these links are considered to be one website vouching for the validity of another website. Some website owners may be willing to do this in return for a link to their website on your blog. This is known as reciprocal linking and some search engines may not value this link as highly as a link which is not reciprocated. There are also some link exchange programs but these links may not be beneficial because many search engines consider the rank of the website linking to your blog. Therefore, if the website linking to your blog does not rank well, the back link will not improve search engine rankings significantly. "

    "title": "10 Aturan Emas Untuk Kencan Online yang Sukses.",
    "body": "2021/01/21 - Seperti yang diketahui semua orang, metode favorit kawin dan kencan untuk lajang di seluruh dunia adalah bergabung dengan situs kencan online. Tetapi yang tidak disadari kebanyakan orang adalah bahwa hanya sekitar 10% anggota situs kencan yang benar-benar bertemu dengan mitra jangka panjang di situs pilihan mereka dan 70% kekalahan bahkan tidak menerima satu pesan pun dari anggota lain. Jika Anda mengikuti 10 langkah sederhana yang diuraikan di bawah ini, Anda juga dapat bergabung dengan 10% orang yang menemukan cinta dan romansa secara online.    Pilih situs yang tepat. Booming dalam kencan online telah memberikan banyak pilihan bagi konsumen, tetapi Anda harus meluangkan beberapa saat untuk memutuskan jenis pasangan yang Anda cari, belum lagi kota atau kota tempat Anda ingin dia berada. . Ada situs niche yang melayani semua sektor (orang tua tunggal, pengendara sepeda motor, kaum gay, dll. ) Dan situs umum yang menyambut semua pendatang seperti halnya situs dan situs khusus kota atau negara dengan perspektif global. Memilih situs yang tepat untuk Anda mungkin merupakan keputusan paling penting yang akan Anda buat saat mencari mitra secara online.     Pilih nama pengguna yang bagus. Kesan pertama selalu terakhir dan identitas online yang Anda berikan kepada diri Anda sendiri adalah hal pertama yang akan dilihat anggota lain sebelum mereka memeriksa profil Anda. Karya ‘lucu’, ‘samar’ berfungsi dan Anda tidak akan melakukan kesalahan jauh bahkan jika Anda memutuskan untuk menggunakan nama kristen Anda sendiri; tetapi jika Anda memilih cara yang cabul atau menjurus ke arah seksual (yang tampaknya dilakukan oleh banyak pria), Anda akan menemukan bahwa anggota lain akan memberi Anda tempat yang luas.     Unggah foto. Ini penting karena sebagian besar orang hanya mencari anggota yang mau repot memasukkan foto; Anda ingin melihat seperti apa penampilan anggota lain sehingga masuk akal bahwa orang lain akan merasakan hal yang sama tentang Anda. Jika satu-satunya foto yang Anda miliki tidak terlalu bagus, Anda selalu dapat menyebutkannya di profil Anda - masih lebih baik daripada tidak ada foto sama sekali.     Lengkapi profil Anda. Tidak ada yang lebih tidak menyenangkan daripada profil yang berteriak “Saya tidak bisa melakukan ini dengan benar”. Jika Anda tidak punya waktu untuk menyelesaikan semua kategori saat Anda mendaftar, luangkan waktu untuk melakukannya sedini mungkin.     Bersikaplah optimis dan positif. Jika Anda merasa sedikit sedih atau kurang percaya diri, sekarang bukan waktunya untuk mengatakannya saat Anda menulis deskripsi tentang diri Anda. Jika Anda tampil sebagai orang yang percaya diri, bahagia, dan penuh kesenangan, Anda akan mendapatkan lebih banyak perhatian daripada jika Anda tampil sebagai mono-silabic atau down dalam kesedihan. Dan ingat, humor adalah pemecah kebekuan dan afrodisiak yang hebat.     Perluas kriteria pencarian Anda. Jika Anda umumnya memilih orang yang memiliki rambut pirang, mata biru dan antara 5’4 “dan 5’6” dan Anda mempersempit pencarian Anda hanya pada hal-hal spesifik ini, maka Anda mungkin kehilangan banyak anggota lain yang Anda juga akan menemukan sama menariknya. Untuk memulainya, cukup cari berdasarkan jenis kelamin, usia dan lokasi dan dengan begitu Anda akan memberi diri Anda pilihan seluas mungkin.     Jangan secara otomatis mengabaikan orang. Jika Anda menerima pesan dari seseorang yang profilnya Anda sukai tetapi tidak mau repot-repot menyertakan fotonya, Anda tetap harus membalas dan meminta mereka untuk mengirimkan foto ke alamat email biasa Anda. Anda akan menemukan bahwa banyak orang lebih bersedia melakukan ini daripada memposting foto untuk dilihat semua orang.     Gunakan semua fitur yang ditawarkan. Banyak situs menyediakan lebih dari sekedar sistem email internal. Beberapa situs mungkin menyertakan pesan suara sementara yang lain memungkinkan anggota untuk mengobrol dan menggoda secara ‘waktu nyata’ dengan anggota lain dan semakin Anda memanfaatkan semua yang tersedia untuk Anda, semakin besar kesempatan Anda untuk melakukan kontak dengan seseorang yang istimewa.     Bersikaplah proaktif. Setelah Anda mendaftar dan melengkapi profil Anda, jangan menunggu orang lain menghubungi Anda. Saat Anda melihat seseorang yang menurut Anda cocok dengan diri Anda sendiri, tulis surat kepada mereka dan perkenalkan diri Anda. Dan jangan hanya mengatakan ‘Hai, saya suka profil Anda’, beri tahu mereka alasan Anda menulis kepada mereka dan tunjukkan kesamaan yang Anda yakini. Pesan pembuka yang panjang akan menciptakan kesan yang jauh lebih baik daripada pesan pendek yang asal-asalan.     Periksa kembali situsnya. Situs kencan paling populer memiliki orang-orang baru yang bergabung setiap saat jadi ingatlah untuk masuk setidaknya sekali setiap hari untuk melihat anggota terbaru dan Anda kemudian dapat menghubungi siapa pun yang Anda sukai sebelum orang lain mendapatkan kesempatan untuk melakukannya. Selain itu, Anda harus ingat bahwa di sebagian besar situs, anggota yang paling banyak log in muncul di daftar pencarian yang lebih tinggi daripada mereka yang tidak, sehingga profil Anda akan lebih mudah dikenali oleh orang-orang yang mungkin cocok dengan Anda.  Jadi begitulah - kencan online yang sukses bukanlah ilmu roket; ini hanya membutuhkan sedikit pemikiran dan sedikit usaha dan jika Anda mematuhi 10 aturan yang telah saya uraikan di atas, maka kehidupan pribadi Anda akan segera menerima permulaan yang layak.
