As the descriptive name implies, HDCP is all about protecting the integrity of various audio and video content as it travels over a multiplicity of different types of interfaces.

<p>Is HDCP Free?</p>

<p>No.  HDCP requires an authorized license. The license can be obtained through Digital Content Protection, which is a subsidiary of Intel Corporation.
