Yet you need them more than ever, now that competition is swooping down faster than business opportunities are taking off. And you realize that without them, your big dreams for a flourishing enterprise could rapidly go up in smoke. But you don't have to manage all business functions in-house.

Why Outsource Work?

Because you don't have the time to do it yourself.
You've got a product to develop and you've got to get it into the market before your competitor does.
Because you don't have the money to do it yourself.
Your business is growing exponentially but your resources can't cope with the growth.
Because you'd rather focus on mission-critical issues.
You're not interested in frittering away time and energy on non-core functions.
Because you don't have the skills to do it yourself.
You need the best talent in the world, but it's scarce out of reach just not available in your country.

In today's globalized and networked economy, outsourcing has never been so easy or made so much business sense. The question is not "Why outsource?" but rather, "Why not?"

The convergent economy

Converging technologies of telecommunication, information technology and media have redefined the way we do business, with electronic commerce and enterprise systems becoming a way of life. Correspondingly, there has been a sharp increase in the need for qualified software professionals to manage these functions. Demand exceeds supply, and the dearth of human resources has resulted in increased personnel costs, longer time to market and longer product development cycles.

Chances are, you won't find these highly skilled people in your own backyard. Yet you need them more than ever, now that competition is swooping down faster than business opportunities are taking off. And you realize that without them, your big dreams for a flourishing enterprise could rapidly go up in smoke. But you don't have to manage all business functions in-house. Outsourcing provides a neat solution to several of your business problems.

25 reasons why outsourcing makes business sense

The Outsourcing Institute finds, "Outsourcing is rapidly becoming an accepted management tool for redefining and re energizing the corporation. It challenges today's executives to rethink the traditional, vertically integrated firm in favor of a more flexible organization structured around core competencies and long-term, outside relationships."

Highlights:

Global giants such as IBM, Microsoft, Novell, Oracle, AT&T, Fujitsu, Motorola, Digital, Hewlett-Packard Philips, General Electric, IBM, Reebok, Fujitsu, British Aerospace, General Motors and Sears are keeping ahead of their rivals thanks to the competitive advantage conferred on them by some of the best software companies in India . You too can benefit immensely from a successful outsourcing strategy.
Several convergent forces like an exponential increase of technology in the workplace, electronic commerce, enterprise systems and a sharp increase in internet related new entities are resulting in an increased demand for software professionals. The need is further compounded by the lack of trained programmers in the developed countries, especially United States , Western Europe and Japan .
Demand exceeds supply, which has led to increased labor costs, longer product development and even longer time to market. A recent Wall Street Journal article related a greater willingness on the part of CIOs to outsource software work that is not mission critical.
