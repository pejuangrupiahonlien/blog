CNC stands for Computer numerical control. Just about every business that operates a manufacturing machine will usually have a cnc programming service operating it. The basic function of a cnc programming service has a cnc machine running it. The cnc machine is an automatic, precise, and consistent motion control mechanism. In the past, most automated machines needed someone to stand by the machine to make sure it was lined up properly and made sure that it repeated a certain function that is required from the machine. For a better explanation, I'm going to use the example the website I researched for this information used to make things a bit more clear. A drill press is used to machine holes, this is a repetitive motion, however, a person must stand over the machine to line up the drill with the holes and make sure the drill stays lined up. A person is required to do something every step of the way. However, a person can only do so much, and as production grows so will the amount of “holes” so to speak, and the operator will eventually find it hard to keep up. In order to create more production, a cnc programming service and set up can be added. The cnc machine can do everything that an operator would be required to do. Once the machine is setup and running, it can take the place of the operators, the cnc machine is so easy to run, the operators tend to get bored during lengthy productions.

The cnc machine or course can do much more complicated operations that require much higher skill levels. A cnc programming service can improve automation so much that most of the time operator intervention can be reduced or all together eliminated to do other things. The second benefit is that cnc programming services and technology is consistent and accurate and once the program is verified, the machine will run efficiently and consistent, no matter how many work pieces need to be produced. A third benefit offered by most forms of CNC machine tools is flexibility. Since these machines are run from programs, running a different work piece is almost as easy as loading a different program. Once a program has been verified and executed for one production run, it can be easily recalled the next time the work piece is to be run. This leads to yet another benefit, a fast change over. Since these machines are very easy to setup and run, and since programs can be easily loaded, they allow very short setup time. Rather than applying completely mechanical devices to cause motion as is required on most conventional machine tools, CNC machines allow motion control in a revolutionary manner. All forms of CNC equipment have two or more directions of motion, called axes. These axes can be precisely and automatically positioned along their lengths of travel. If you need more information about cnc programming services there is a lot of information about it online.
