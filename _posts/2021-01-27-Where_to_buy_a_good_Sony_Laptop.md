If you’ve decided that you want a Sony laptop, then good for you – some of them really are very good. Unfortunately, the good ones also tend to be dazzlingly expensive, which is why you’re probably looking for ways of getting that laptop a little cheaper. Here are a few suggestions.

If you live near a Sony Store, then they are probably one of the best places to get cheap Sony laptops. Not only are you buying directly from the manufacturer, cutting out a few middlemen in between, but you will often find that they have a good selection of special offers on slightly older models and refurbished laptops – unless you always need the latest leading-edge technology, you’ll often find that these models are perfectly good.

If there’s no Sony Store around, try your local independent computer shop. These shops are often very good at giving impartial advice about all the different models available, and won’t overcharge you massively like the high street and big-box computer retailers like to do. If you’re lucky, you might find that they have a used or reduced Sony laptop, or know where to get one.

Another thing to try is looking online at auction sites such as eBay. Used laptops there can be very cheap indeed, and as good Sony laptops are so hard-wearing there is usually no reason not to buy them used. However, do be careful not to fall for any eBay scams when buying something as expensive as a laptop – always check the description carefully, and read up on eBay works if you’re ever unsure about an offer you see (use eBay’s own ‘Help’ button). And whatever you do, never pay for laptops by Western Union wire transfer, as the moment you do that, your money is gone forever.
