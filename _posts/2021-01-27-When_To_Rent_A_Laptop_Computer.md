Most companies either lease or buy their computer equipment, but why or when should a company rent laptop or notebook computers?

Here are a few reasons to rent a laptop computer:

-If you need technology on short notice or for a short time, it is best to rent a laptop.

-If you need a large quantity of laptop computers for a training class, it is best to rent laptops.

-If your laptop computers are on back order but your staff isn't, it's best to rent laptops for immediate installation.

-If you need a wireless laptop computers for travel and all your company laptops and notebook computers are wired.
People confuse computer renting with leasing.

Renting is short term in nature and is very flexible. Leasing, like buying is a fixed arrangement.

You can extend the rental or cancel at any time with no penalty. Leases can't be cancelled without a 'severe penalty'.

Renting laptops is totally flexible, requires no capital budget and can often be accomplished with a company credit card. For most companies, renting is as easy as getting office supplies.

Rental companies have expert computer technicians who deliver, install and test your laptop rental right at your office, training room, trade show booth, seminar, convention or conference.

Rental companies have everything you need and a backup plan if something unexpected happens.

Other reasons why businesses rent laptop computers include temporary offices, traveling executives and temporary employees.

Temporary Offices
Temporary offices can be made complete with rental laptop computers, printers, copiers and fax machines. The hardware will be configured to your company specifications and installed at any remote location in the United States or Canada.

Rentacomputer.com has set up temporary offices in hotel rooms, trailers, warehouses and convention centers. Temporary offices have been set up for State and Federal Government agencies such as FEMA, the FBI and the IRS. Also legal firms, television networks covering hurricane disasters, movie studios setting up "on location", and new building construction sites, corporate mergers and takeovers.

Traveling Executives
Traveling executives won't have to carry portable laptop computers through airports or other public transportation facilities. Executives can have technology, preconfigured and tested, waiting at their final destination! Traveling with technology is one hassle that can be easily avoided by calling a computer rental expert like a Temporary Technology Travel Agent.

Temporary Employees
Temporary employees need temporary technology. By renting laptop computers you can coordinate the installation and removal of computers, printers and other technology for any period of time specified. If you hire temporary employees, hire temporary technology too.

Next time you have a temporary or special need, consider renting laptop computer technology and technical expertise.
