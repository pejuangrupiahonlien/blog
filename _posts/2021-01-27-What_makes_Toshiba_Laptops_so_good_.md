Toshiba laptops have a well-deserved reputation for being some of the best laptops in the world. But what makes them so good?

Well, first of all, Toshiba laptops are very sturdily built. If you drop one, it won’t usually break, nor will they break through normal wear and tear like cheap Dells can – Toshibas don’t get cracked cases and have keys fall off the keyboard, and if they ever did then Toshiba would fix it very quickly. This high build quality is important to people who will have their laptop for a long time, as well as people who travel around a lot with their laptops and so need to take them as luggage on planes.

Secondly, Toshiba laptops are very light. Again, this is important to travellers, but it is also important to people who are just using their laptop normally, carrying it from home to their office or simply perching it on their lap at home. Heavy laptops can be a real pain, making it feel like an effort to pick up the computer and quickly check or alter something, while light ones are far more practical.

However, as with other Japanese-made laptops, this extra sturdiness and ultra-light weight comes with a price. Toshiba laptops can be up to 50% more expensive than the cheapest models on the market with the same processor, RAM and so on, simply due to the cost of the better build quality and having to pay Japanese workers’ salaries. Computing tends to be a race to the bottom, with the cheapest computers gaining the largest market share, which leaves Toshiba courting the more computer-savvy buyers who really need a high-quality laptop for their work. If you do rely on your laptop for anything, though, you would do well to see the extra cost as an investment and consider getting a Toshiba, or a similar high-quality laptop.
